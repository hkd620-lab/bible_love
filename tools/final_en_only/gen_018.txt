T|EN=Genesis 18|KO=창세기 18장
V|N=1|EN=And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;|KO=
V|N=2|EN=And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,|KO=
V|N=3|EN=And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:|KO=
V|N=4|EN=Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:|KO=
V|N=5|EN=And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.|KO=
V|N=6|EN=And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.|KO=
V|N=7|EN=And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.|KO=
V|N=8|EN=And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.|KO=
V|N=9|EN=And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.|KO=
V|N=10|EN=And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.|KO=
V|N=11|EN=Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.|KO=
V|N=12|EN=Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?|KO=
V|N=13|EN=And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?|KO=
V|N=14|EN=Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.|KO=
V|N=15|EN=Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.|KO=
V|N=16|EN=And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.|KO=
V|N=17|EN=And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;|KO=
V|N=18|EN=Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?|KO=
V|N=19|EN=For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.|KO=
V|N=20|EN=And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;|KO=
V|N=21|EN=I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.|KO=
V|N=22|EN=And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.|KO=
V|N=23|EN=And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?|KO=
V|N=24|EN=Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?|KO=
V|N=25|EN=That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?|KO=
V|N=26|EN=And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.|KO=
V|N=27|EN=And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes:|KO=
V|N=28|EN=Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.|KO=
V|N=29|EN=And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty’s sake.|KO=
V|N=30|EN=And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.|KO=
V|N=31|EN=And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty’s sake.|KO=
V|N=32|EN=And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten’s sake.|KO=
V|N=33|EN=And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.|KO=
