V|N=23|EN=I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.|KO=
V|N=24|EN=When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.|KO=
V|N=25|EN=Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:|KO=
V|N=26|EN=While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.|KO=
V|N=27|EN=When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:|KO=
