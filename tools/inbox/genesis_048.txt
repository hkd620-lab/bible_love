V|N=5|EN=And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.|KO=
V|N=6|EN=And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.|KO=
V|N=7|EN=And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.|KO=
V|N=8|EN=And Israel beheld Joseph’s sons, and said, Who are these?|KO=

V|N=12|EN=And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.|KO=

V|N=14|EN=And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.|KO=

V|N=16|EN=The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.|KO=
V|N=17|EN=And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head unto Manasseh’s head.|KO=
