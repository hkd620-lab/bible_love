V|N=11|EN=If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and those that are ready to be slain;|KO=
V|N=12|EN=If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it? and he that keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it? and shall not he render to every man according to his works?|KO=
V|N=13|EN=My son, eat thou honey, because it is good; and the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste:|KO=

V|N=15|EN=Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place:|KO=

V|N=21|EN=My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: and meddle not with them that are given to change:|KO=
V|N=22|EN=For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?|KO=
V|N=23|EN=These things also belong to the wise. It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment.|KO=
V|N=24|EN=He that saith unto the wicked, Thou are righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:|KO=
V|N=25|EN=But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.|KO=
V|N=26|EN=Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer.|KO=
V|N=27|EN=Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house.|KO=
V|N=28|EN=Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive not with thy lips.|KO=
V|N=29|EN=Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.|KO=

V|N=31|EN=And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.|KO=
V|N=32|EN=Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and received instruction.|KO=
V|N=33|EN=Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:|KO=
V|N=34|EN=So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.|KO=
