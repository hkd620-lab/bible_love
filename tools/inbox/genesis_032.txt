T|EN=Genesis 32|KO=
V|N=1|EN=And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.|KO=
V|N=2|EN=And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God’s host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.|KO=
V|N=3|EN=And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.|KO=
V|N=4|EN=And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:|KO=
V|N=5|EN=And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.|KO=
V|N=6|EN=And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.|KO=
V|N=7|EN=Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;|KO=
V|N=8|EN=And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.|KO=
V|N=9|EN=And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:|KO=
V|N=10|EN=I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.|KO=
V|N=11|EN=Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children.|KO=
V|N=12|EN=And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.|KO=
V|N=13|EN=And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;|KO=
V|N=14|EN=Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,|KO=
V|N=15|EN=Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.|KO=
V|N=16|EN=And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.|KO=
V|N=17|EN=And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?|KO=
V|N=18|EN=Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob’s; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.|KO=
V|N=19|EN=And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.|KO=
V|N=20|EN=And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.|KO=
V|N=21|EN=So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.|KO=
V|N=22|EN=And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.|KO=
V|N=23|EN=And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.|KO=
V|N=24|EN=And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.|KO=
V|N=25|EN=And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.|KO=
V|N=26|EN=And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.|KO=
V|N=27|EN=And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.|KO=
V|N=28|EN=And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.|KO=
V|N=29|EN=And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.|KO=
V|N=30|EN=And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.|KO=
V|N=31|EN=And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.|KO=
V|N=32|EN=Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew that shrank.|KO=
