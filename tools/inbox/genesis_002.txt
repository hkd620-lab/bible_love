V|N=5|EN=And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.|KO=
V|N=6|EN=But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.|KO=

V|N=11|EN=The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;|KO=
V|N=12|EN=And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.|KO=
V|N=13|EN=And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.|KO=
V|N=14|EN=And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.|KO=
V|N=15|EN=And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.|KO=
V|N=16|EN=And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:|KO=

V|N=19|EN=And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.|KO=
