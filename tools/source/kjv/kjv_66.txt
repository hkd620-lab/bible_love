gen	1:1	In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
gen	1:2	And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon
gen	1:3	And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
gen	1:4	And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light
gen	1:5	And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.
gen	1:6	And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters,
gen	1:7	And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were
gen	1:8	And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the
gen	1:9	And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together
gen	1:10	And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of
gen	1:11	And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding
gen	1:12	And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after
gen	1:13	And the evening and the morning were the third day.
gen	1:14	And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven
gen	1:16	And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day,
gen	1:17	And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light
gen	1:19	And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
gen	1:20	And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving
gen	1:21	And God created great whales, and every living creature that
gen	1:22	And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill
gen	1:23	And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
gen	1:24	And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after
gen	1:25	And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle
gen	1:26	And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:
gen	1:27	So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created
gen	1:28	And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
gen	1:29	And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed,
gen	1:30	And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,
gen	1:31	And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was
gen	2:1	Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of
gen	2:2	And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and
gen	2:3	And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that
gen	2:4	These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when
gen	2:6	But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole
gen	2:7	And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
gen	2:8	And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he
gen	2:9	And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is
gen	2:10	And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence
gen	2:11	The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the
gen	2:13	And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that
gen	2:14	And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which
gen	2:15	And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of

gen	2:21	And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he
gen	2:23	And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my
gen	2:24	Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall

gen	3:6	And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that
gen	3:7	And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they
gen	3:8	And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in
gen	3:9	And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art
gen	3:11	And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten
gen	3:12	And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she
gen	3:13	And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast
gen	3:14	And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done
gen	3:16	Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and
gen	3:17	And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice
gen	3:20	And Adam called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother
gen	3:21	Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of
gen	3:22	And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to
gen	3:24	So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden
gen	4:1	And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and
gen	4:2	And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of

gen	4:4	And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of
gen	4:6	And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy
gen	4:8	And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when
gen	4:9	And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he
gen	4:11	And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her
gen	4:13	And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can
gen	4:14	Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the
gen	4:15	And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,
gen	4:16	And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the
gen	4:17	And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he
gen	4:18	And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and
gen	4:19	And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah,
gen	4:20	And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents,
gen	4:21	And his brother’s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such

gen	5:1	This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God
gen	5:3	And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his
gen	5:6	And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos: 5:7 And
gen	5:9	And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan: 5:10 And Enos lived
gen	5:12	And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel: 5:13 And
gen	5:15	And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared: 5:16

gen	5:28	And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a
gen	5:30	And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five
gen	5:32	And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham,
gen	6:1	And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the
gen	6:3	And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for
gen	6:4	There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that,
gen	6:5	And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and
gen	6:6	And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it
gen	6:7	And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the
gen	6:8	But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.
gen	6:9	These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect
gen	6:10	And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
gen	6:11	The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled
gen	6:12	And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for
gen	6:13	And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me;
gen	6:14	Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the
gen	6:15	And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length
gen	6:16	A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou
gen	6:17	And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the
gen	6:18	But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come
gen	6:19	And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt
gen	6:20	Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of
gen	6:21	And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt
gen	6:22	Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did
gen	7:1	And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the
gen	7:2	Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male
gen	7:3	Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to
gen	7:4	For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth
gen	7:5	And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.
gen	7:6	And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was
gen	7:7	And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives
gen	7:8	Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls,
gen	7:10	And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the
gen	7:11	In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month,
gen	7:12	And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
gen	7:13	In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth,
gen	7:15	And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all
gen	7:16	And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as
gen	7:17	And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters
gen	7:18	And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the
gen	7:19	And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the
gen	7:20	Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains
gen	7:21	And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and
gen	7:23	And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face
gen	7:24	And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty
gen	8:1	And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the
gen	8:4	And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of
gen	8:5	And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the
gen	8:6	And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the
gen	8:8	Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were
gen	8:10	And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the
gen	8:12	And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove;
gen	8:13	And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the
gen	8:14	And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the
gen	8:15	And God spake unto Noah, saying, 8:16 Go forth of the ark, thou,
gen	8:17	Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of
gen	8:18	And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’
gen	8:20	And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean
gen	8:21	And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his
gen	8:22	While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and
gen	9:1	And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be
gen	9:2	And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast
gen	9:3	Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the
gen	9:4	But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall
gen	9:5	And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of
gen	9:6	Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in
gen	9:7	And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in
gen	9:8	And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, 9:9 And
gen	9:11	And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all
gen	9:12	And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make
gen	9:14	And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth,
gen	9:16	And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that
gen	9:17	And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which
gen	9:18	And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and
gen	9:19	These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth
gen	9:20	And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:
gen	9:21	And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered
gen	9:22	And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father,
gen	9:23	And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their
gen	9:24	And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had
gen	9:25	And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be
gen	9:26	And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be
gen	9:27	God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of
gen	9:28	And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
gen	9:29	And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and
gen	10:1	Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and
gen	10:2	The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and
gen	10:3	And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.
gen	10:4	And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and
gen	10:5	By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands;
gen	10:6	And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.
gen	10:7	And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah,
gen	10:8	And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
gen	10:9	He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said,
gen	10:10	And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and
gen	10:11	Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the
gen	10:13	And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,
gen	10:14	And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and
gen	10:15	And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth, 10:16 And the
gen	10:19	And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest
gen	10:20	These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their
gen	10:21	Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the
gen	10:22	The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud,
gen	10:23	And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.
gen	10:24	And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.
gen	10:25	And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for
gen	10:26	And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and
gen	10:30	And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a
gen	10:31	These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their
gen	10:32	These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their
gen	11:1	And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.
gen	11:2	And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they
gen	11:3	And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn
gen	11:4	And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose
gen	11:5	And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the
gen	11:6	And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all
gen	11:7	Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that
gen	11:8	So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of
gen	11:9	Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did
gen	11:10	These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years
gen	11:12	And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah: 11:13
gen	11:14	And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber: 11:15 And Salah
gen	11:16	And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg: 11:17 And
gen	11:18	And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu: 11:19 And Peleg
gen	11:20	And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: 11:21 And
gen	11:22	And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor: 11:23 And Serug
gen	11:24	And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah: 11:25
gen	11:26	And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and
gen	11:27	Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram,
gen	11:28	And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his
gen	11:29	And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram’s wife
gen	11:30	But Sarai was barren; she had no child.
gen	11:31	And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son’s
gen	11:32	And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah
gen	12:1	Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country,
gen	12:4	So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went
gen	12:5	And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all
gen	12:6	And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto
gen	12:7	And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I
gen	12:8	And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel,
gen	12:9	And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.
gen	12:10	And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into
gen	12:11	And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt,
gen	12:13	Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with
gen	12:14	And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the
gen	12:15	The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before
gen	12:16	And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and
gen	12:17	And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues
gen	12:18	And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast
gen	12:20	And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him
gen	13:1	And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he
gen	13:2	And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
gen	13:3	And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto
gen	13:5	And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and
gen	13:6	And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell
gen	13:7	And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram’s cattle and
gen	13:8	And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee,
gen	13:9	Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee,
gen	13:10	And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan,
gen	13:11	Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed
gen	13:12	Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the
gen	13:13	But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD
gen	13:14	And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from
gen	13:16	And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a
gen	13:17	Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the
gen	13:18	Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of
gen	14:1	And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar,
gen	14:3	All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is
gen	14:4	Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year
gen	14:5	And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that
gen	14:7	And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and
gen	14:8	And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah,
gen	14:10	And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of
gen	14:11	And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their
gen	14:12	And they took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who dwelt in Sodom,
gen	14:13	And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew;
gen	14:14	And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he
gen	14:15	And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by
gen	14:16	And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his
gen	14:17	And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from
gen	14:18	And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and
gen	14:19	And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high
gen	14:21	And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and
gen	14:22	And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand
gen	14:23	That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and
gen	15:1	After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a
gen	15:2	And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go
gen	15:3	And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo,
gen	15:4	And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This
gen	15:5	And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward
gen	15:6	And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for
gen	15:7	And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur
gen	15:8	And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit
gen	15:10	And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst,
gen	15:11	And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them
gen	15:12	And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;
gen	15:13	And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be
gen	15:15	And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried
gen	15:16	But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for
gen	15:17	And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was
gen	15:18	In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying,
gen	16:1	Now Sarai Abram’s wife bare him no children: and she had an
gen	16:2	And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained
gen	16:3	And Sarai Abram’s wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after
gen	16:4	And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw
gen	16:5	And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my
gen	16:6	But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do
gen	16:7	And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the
gen	16:8	And he said, Hagar, Sarai’s maid, whence camest thou? and whither
gen	16:9	And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress,
gen	16:10	And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy
gen	16:11	And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with
gen	16:12	And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man,
gen	16:13	And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou
gen	16:15	And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son’s name,
gen	16:16	And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare
gen	17:1	And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared
gen	17:2	And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will
gen	17:3	And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying, 17:4
gen	17:5	Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name
gen	17:6	And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations
gen	17:7	And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed
gen	17:8	And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land
gen	17:9	And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore,
gen	17:10	This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and
gen	17:11	And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall
gen	17:12	And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you,
gen	17:13	He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy
gen	17:14	And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is
gen	17:15	And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not
gen	17:16	And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I
gen	17:17	Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his
gen	17:20	And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed
gen	17:21	But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall
gen	17:22	And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.
gen	17:23	And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his
gen	17:24	And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was
gen	17:25	And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was
gen	17:26	In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his
gen	17:27	And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with
gen	18:1	And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat
gen	18:6	And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make
gen	18:7	And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good,
gen	18:8	And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed,
gen	18:9	And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said,
gen	18:10	And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the
gen	18:11	Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it
gen	18:12	Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed
gen	18:15	Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.
gen	18:16	And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and
gen	18:17	And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I
gen	18:19	For I know him, that he will command his children and his
gen	18:20	And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is
gen	18:22	And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward
gen	18:23	And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the
gen	18:27	And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me
gen	18:29	And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there
gen	18:30	And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will
gen	18:31	And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the
gen	18:32	And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet
gen	18:33	And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with
gen	19:1	And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the
gen	19:3	And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him,
gen	19:4	But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of
gen	19:6	And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after
gen	19:8	Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let
gen	19:9	And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow
gen	19:10	But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house
gen	19:11	And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with
gen	19:12	And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in
gen	19:14	And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married
gen	19:15	And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,
gen	19:16	And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon
gen	19:17	And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,
gen	19:18	And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD: 19:19 Behold now,
gen	19:21	And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this
gen	19:22	Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou
gen	19:23	The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.
gen	19:24	Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and
gen	19:26	But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a
gen	19:27	And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he
gen	19:29	And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain,
gen	19:30	And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his
gen	19:31	And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and
gen	19:33	And they made their father drink wine that night: and the
gen	19:34	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto
gen	19:35	And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the
gen	19:36	Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
gen	19:37	And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the
gen	19:38	And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name
gen	20:1	And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and
gen	20:2	And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and
gen	20:3	But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him,
gen	20:4	But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou
gen	20:6	And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst
gen	20:7	Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and
gen	20:8	Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his
gen	20:9	Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou
gen	20:10	And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou
gen	20:12	And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my
gen	20:13	And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my
gen	20:14	And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and
gen	20:15	And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where
gen	20:16	And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a
gen	20:17	So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his
gen	20:18	For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of
gen	21:1	And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto
gen	21:2	For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at
gen	21:3	And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him,
gen	21:4	And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as
gen	21:5	And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born
gen	21:6	And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear
gen	21:7	And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should
gen	21:8	And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great
gen	21:9	And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born
gen	21:10	Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her
gen	21:11	And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight because of
gen	21:12	And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight
gen	21:13	And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation,
gen	21:14	And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a
gen	21:15	And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child
gen	21:16	And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off,
gen	21:17	And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called
gen	21:18	Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will
gen	21:19	And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she
gen	21:20	And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the
gen	21:21	And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him
gen	21:22	And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the
gen	21:24	And Abraham said, I will swear.
gen	21:25	And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which
gen	21:26	And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing; neither
gen	21:27	And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech;
gen	21:28	And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
gen	21:29	And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs
gen	21:31	Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they
gen	21:32	Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up,
gen	21:33	And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on
gen	21:34	And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines’ land many days.
gen	22:1	And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt
gen	22:2	And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou
gen	22:3	And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass,
gen	22:4	Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the
gen	22:5	And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass;
gen	22:6	And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon
gen	22:7	And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and
gen	22:9	And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham
gen	22:10	And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay
gen	22:11	And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and
gen	22:12	And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou
gen	22:13	And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind
gen	22:14	And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is
gen	22:15	And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the
gen	22:19	So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and
gen	22:20	And it came to pass after these things, that it was told
gen	22:23	And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor,
gen	22:24	And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah,
gen	23:1	And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these
gen	23:2	And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of
gen	23:3	And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the
gen	23:5	And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, 23:6
gen	23:7	And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the
gen	23:8	And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I
gen	23:10	And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the
gen	23:12	And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.
gen	23:13	And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the
gen	23:14	And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, 23:15 My lord,
gen	23:16	And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron
gen	23:17	And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before
gen	23:19	And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the
gen	23:20	And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto
gen	24:1	And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had
gen	24:2	And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled
gen	24:5	And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be
gen	24:7	The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father’s house, and
gen	24:8	And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou
gen	24:9	And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his
gen	24:10	And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and
gen	24:11	And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well
gen	24:12	And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send
gen	24:13	Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of
gen	24:15	And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold,
gen	24:16	And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had
gen	24:17	And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee,
gen	24:18	And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her
gen	24:19	And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw
gen	24:20	And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran
gen	24:21	And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the
gen	24:22	And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the
gen	24:25	She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender
gen	24:26	And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.
gen	24:27	And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who
gen	24:28	And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother’s house these
gen	24:29	And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran
gen	24:30	And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon
gen	24:31	And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore
gen	24:32	And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and
gen	24:33	And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will
gen	24:34	And he said, I am Abraham’s servant.
gen	24:35	And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become
gen	24:36	And Sarah my master’s wife bare a son to my master when she was
gen	24:37	And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife
gen	24:38	But thou shalt go unto my father’s house, and to my kindred, and
gen	24:39	And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not
gen	24:40	And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his
gen	24:42	And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my
gen	24:45	And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah
gen	24:46	And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder,
gen	24:47	And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she
gen	24:48	And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed
gen	24:49	And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell
gen	24:50	Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth
gen	24:51	Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be
gen	24:52	And it came to pass, that, when Abraham’s servant heard their
gen	24:53	And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of
gen	24:54	And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him,
gen	24:55	And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with
gen	24:56	And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath
gen	24:57	And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her
gen	24:58	And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with
gen	24:59	And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and
gen	24:60	And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our
gen	24:61	And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the
gen	24:62	And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt
gen	24:63	And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and
gen	24:64	And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she
gen	24:65	For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh
gen	24:66	And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.
gen	24:67	And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took
gen	25:1	Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.
gen	25:2	And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and
gen	25:3	And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were
gen	25:4	And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah,
gen	25:5	And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.
gen	25:6	But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham
gen	25:7	And these are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he
gen	25:8	Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an
gen	25:9	And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of
gen	25:11	And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed
gen	25:12	Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom
gen	25:17	And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and
gen	25:18	And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as
gen	25:19	And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham
gen	25:21	And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was
gen	25:22	And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If
gen	25:23	And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two
gen	25:24	And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there
gen	25:25	And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and
gen	25:26	And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on
gen	25:27	And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the
gen	25:28	And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but
gen	25:29	And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was
gen	25:31	And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.
gen	25:32	And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit
gen	25:34	Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did
gen	26:1	And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that
gen	26:2	And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt;
gen	26:6	And Isaac dwelt in Gerar: 26:7 And the men of the place asked him
gen	26:8	And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that
gen	26:9	And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is
gen	26:10	And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of
gen	26:11	And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth
gen	26:12	Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an
gen	26:13	And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he
gen	26:15	For all the wells which his father’s servants had digged in the
gen	26:16	And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much
gen	26:17	And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of
gen	26:18	And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged
gen	26:19	And Isaac’s servants digged in the valley, and found there a
gen	26:20	And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac’s herdmen,
gen	26:21	And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he
gen	26:22	And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for
gen	26:23	And he went up from thence to Beersheba.
gen	26:24	And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am
gen	26:25	And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the
gen	26:26	Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his
gen	26:27	And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye
gen	26:30	And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.
gen	26:31	And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to
gen	26:32	And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac’s servants came,
gen	26:33	And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is
gen	26:34	And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the
gen	27:1	And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were
gen	27:2	And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my
gen	27:5	And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went
gen	27:6	And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy
gen	27:8	Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I
gen	27:9	Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of
gen	27:11	And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is
gen	27:13	And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only
gen	27:14	And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and
gen	27:15	And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which
gen	27:16	And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands,
gen	27:18	And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said,
gen	27:20	And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it
gen	27:21	And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may
gen	27:22	And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and
gen	27:23	And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his
gen	27:24	And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.
gen	27:25	And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s
gen	27:26	And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me,
gen	27:27	And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of
gen	27:30	And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of
gen	27:31	And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his
gen	27:32	And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I
gen	27:33	And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he
gen	27:34	And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a
gen	27:35	And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away
gen	27:36	And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath
gen	27:39	And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy
gen	27:41	And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his
gen	27:42	And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and
gen	27:43	Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to Laban
gen	28:2	Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother’s
gen	28:3	And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply
gen	28:5	And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban,
gen	28:6	When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to
gen	28:10	And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.
gen	28:11	And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all
gen	28:12	And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the
gen	28:13	And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD
gen	28:15	And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places
gen	28:16	And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD
gen	28:17	And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is
gen	28:18	And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that
gen	28:19	And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of
gen	28:20	And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will
gen	29:1	Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the
gen	29:2	And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there
gen	29:3	And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the
gen	29:4	And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they
gen	29:5	And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they
gen	29:6	And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well:
gen	29:7	And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the
gen	29:8	And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered
gen	29:9	And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father’s
gen	29:10	And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban
gen	29:11	And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.
gen	29:12	And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s brother, and that
gen	29:13	And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his
gen	29:14	And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And
gen	29:15	And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother,
gen	29:17	Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well
gen	29:18	And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years
gen	29:19	And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that
gen	29:20	And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto
gen	29:21	And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are
gen	29:22	And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a
gen	29:23	And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his
gen	29:24	And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an
gen	29:25	And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah:
gen	29:26	And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give
gen	29:27	Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service
gen	29:28	And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel
gen	29:29	And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be
gen	29:30	And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more
gen	29:31	And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb:
gen	29:32	And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name
gen	29:33	And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the
gen	29:34	And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time
gen	29:35	And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will
gen	30:1	And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel
gen	30:2	And Jacob’s anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I
gen	30:3	And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she
gen	30:4	And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in
gen	30:5	And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.
gen	30:6	And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my
gen	30:7	And Bilhah Rachel’s maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second
gen	30:8	And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my
gen	30:9	When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her
gen	30:10	And Zilpah Leah’s maid bare Jacob a son.
gen	30:11	And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.
gen	30:12	And Zilpah Leah’s maid bare Jacob a second son.
gen	30:13	And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me
gen	30:14	And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found
gen	30:15	And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken
gen	30:16	And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went
gen	30:17	And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob
gen	30:18	And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given
gen	30:19	And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.
gen	30:20	And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my
gen	30:21	And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.
gen	30:22	And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened
gen	30:23	And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away
gen	30:25	And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob
gen	30:26	Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee,
gen	30:27	And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in
gen	30:28	And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.
gen	30:29	And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and
gen	30:30	For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now
gen	30:32	I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence
gen	30:33	So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it
gen	30:34	And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy
gen	30:35	And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and
gen	30:36	And he set three days’ journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and
gen	30:37	And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and
gen	30:38	And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the
gen	30:39	And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth
gen	30:40	And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the
gen	30:41	And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did
gen	30:42	But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the
gen	30:43	And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and
gen	31:1	And he heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, Jacob hath taken
gen	31:2	And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was
gen	31:3	And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy
gen	31:4	And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his
gen	31:6	And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.
gen	31:7	And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times;
gen	31:8	If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the
gen	31:9	Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given
gen	31:10	And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that
gen	31:11	And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob:
gen	31:12	And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which
gen	31:13	I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and
gen	31:14	And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any
gen	31:16	For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is
gen	31:17	Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;
gen	31:18	And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he
gen	31:19	And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the
gen	31:20	And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he
gen	31:21	So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over
gen	31:22	And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.
gen	31:23	And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven
gen	31:24	And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said
gen	31:25	Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the
gen	31:26	And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast
gen	31:28	And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou
gen	31:29	It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of
gen	31:30	And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore
gen	31:32	With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before
gen	31:33	And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into
gen	31:34	Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel’s
gen	31:35	And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I
gen	31:36	And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered
gen	31:38	This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she
gen	31:39	That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare
gen	31:40	Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by
gen	31:41	Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee
gen	31:42	Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of
gen	31:43	And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my
gen	31:44	Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and
gen	31:45	And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.
gen	31:46	And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took
gen	31:47	And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.
gen	31:48	And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this
gen	31:50	If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other
gen	31:51	And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this
gen	31:53	The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their
gen	31:54	Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his
gen	31:55	And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and
gen	32:1	And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
gen	32:2	And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God’s host: and he
gen	32:3	And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the
gen	32:4	And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord
gen	32:6	And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy
gen	32:7	Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the
gen	32:9	And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father
gen	32:11	Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the
gen	32:12	And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed
gen	32:13	And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came
gen	32:16	And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove
gen	32:17	And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother
gen	32:19	And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that
gen	32:20	And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For
gen	32:21	So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that
gen	32:22	And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two
gen	32:23	And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over
gen	32:24	And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him
gen	32:25	And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched
gen	32:26	And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I
gen	32:27	And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.
gen	32:28	And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel:
gen	32:29	And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.
gen	32:30	And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen
gen	32:31	And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he
gen	32:32	Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which
gen	33:1	And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came,
gen	33:2	And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah
gen	33:3	And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground
gen	33:4	And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck,
gen	33:5	And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children;
gen	33:6	Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they
gen	33:7	And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves:
gen	33:8	And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And
gen	33:9	And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast
gen	33:10	And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in
gen	33:11	Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because
gen	33:12	And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will
gen	33:13	And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are
gen	33:14	Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I
gen	33:15	And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that
gen	33:16	So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.
gen	33:17	And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made
gen	33:18	And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the
gen	33:19	And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent,
gen	33:20	And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.
gen	34:1	And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went
gen	34:2	And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the
gen	34:3	And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved
gen	34:4	And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this
gen	34:5	And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his
gen	34:6	And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune
gen	34:7	And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it:
gen	34:8	And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem
gen	34:9	And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us,
gen	34:10	And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you;
gen	34:11	And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me
gen	34:12	Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according
gen	34:13	And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father
gen	34:14	And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our
gen	34:15	But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be,
gen	34:17	But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will
gen	34:18	And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor’s son.
gen	34:19	And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had
gen	34:20	And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city,
gen	34:22	Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us,
gen	34:23	Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of
gen	34:24	And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went
gen	34:25	And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that
gen	34:26	And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the
gen	34:27	The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city,
gen	34:28	They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that
gen	34:30	And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make
gen	34:31	And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?
gen	35:1	And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there:
gen	35:2	Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with
gen	35:4	And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their
gen	35:5	And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities
gen	35:6	So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is,
gen	35:7	And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel:
gen	35:8	But Deborah Rebekah’s nurse died, and she was buried beneath
gen	35:9	And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram,
gen	35:10	And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be
gen	35:11	And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and
gen	35:13	And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.
gen	35:14	And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him,
gen	35:15	And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him,
gen	35:16	And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way
gen	35:17	And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the

gen	35:29	And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his

gen	36:2	Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter
gen	36:4	And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel; 36:5 And
gen	36:6	And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all
gen	36:7	For their riches were more than that they might dwell together;
gen	36:8	Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.
gen	36:9	And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites
gen	36:11	And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and
gen	36:12	And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau’s son; and she bare to

gen	36:16	Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes
gen	36:17	And these are the sons of Reuel Esau’s son; duke Nahath, duke
gen	36:18	And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau’s wife; duke Jeush,
gen	36:19	These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their
gen	36:20	These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land;
gen	36:22	And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan’s
gen	36:23	And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and
gen	36:24	And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this
gen	36:25	And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the
gen	36:26	And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and
gen	36:27	The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.
gen	36:28	The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran.
gen	36:29	These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke
gen	36:31	And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before
gen	36:32	And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his
gen	36:33	And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in
gen	36:34	And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his
gen	36:35	And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in
gen	36:36	And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.
gen	36:37	And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in
gen	36:38	And Saul died, and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his
gen	36:39	And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his
gen	36:40	And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau,
gen	37:1	And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in
gen	37:2	These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years
gen	37:3	Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he
gen	37:4	And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than
gen	37:5	And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they
gen	37:6	And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have
gen	37:8	And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or
gen	37:9	And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and
gen	37:10	And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his
gen	37:12	And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem.
gen	37:13	And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock
gen	37:14	And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with
gen	37:15	And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in
gen	37:17	And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say,
gen	37:18	And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto
gen	37:19	And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.
gen	37:20	Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some
gen	37:21	And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands;
gen	37:22	And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this
gen	37:23	And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren,
gen	37:25	And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes
gen	37:26	And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay
gen	37:28	Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and
gen	37:29	And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in
gen	37:30	And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not;
gen	37:33	And he knew it, and said, It is my son’s coat; an evil beast
gen	37:34	And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins,
gen	37:35	And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him;
gen	37:36	And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer
gen	38:1	And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his
gen	38:2	And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name
gen	38:3	And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.
gen	38:4	And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name
gen	38:5	And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name
gen	38:6	And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.
gen	38:7	And Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD;
gen	38:8	And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother’s wife, and
gen	38:9	And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to
gen	38:10	And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he
gen	38:11	Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at
gen	38:12	And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah’s wife died;
gen	38:13	And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up
gen	38:14	And she put her widow’s garments off from her, and covered her
gen	38:15	When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she
gen	38:16	And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee,
gen	38:19	And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and
gen	38:20	And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite,
gen	38:21	Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the
gen	38:22	And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also
gen	38:23	And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed:
gen	38:24	And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told
gen	38:25	When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law,
gen	38:26	And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more
gen	38:27	And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold,
gen	38:28	And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out
gen	38:29	And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his
gen	38:30	And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread
gen	39:1	And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of
gen	39:2	And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he
gen	39:3	And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD
gen	39:4	And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he
gen	39:5	And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer
gen	39:6	And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and he knew not
gen	39:7	And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife
gen	39:8	But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife, Behold, my
gen	39:11	And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the
gen	39:12	And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he
gen	39:13	And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment
gen	39:16	And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.
gen	39:17	And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The
gen	39:19	And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his
gen	39:20	And Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, a
gen	39:21	But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him
gen	39:22	And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the
gen	39:23	The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under
gen	40:1	And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the
gen	40:2	And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the
gen	40:3	And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard,
gen	40:4	And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he
gen	40:5	And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one
gen	40:6	And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon
gen	40:7	And he asked Pharaoh’s officers that were with him in the ward of
gen	40:9	And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him,
gen	40:12	And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The
gen	40:14	But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew
gen	40:16	When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he
gen	40:18	And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation
gen	40:20	And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday,
gen	40:21	And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and
gen	40:23	Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.
gen	41:1	And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh
gen	41:2	And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured
gen	41:3	And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the
gen	41:4	And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven
gen	41:5	And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears
gen	41:6	And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind
gen	41:7	And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears.
gen	41:8	And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled;
gen	41:9	Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember
gen	41:12	And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to
gen	41:13	And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he
gen	41:14	Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him
gen	41:15	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there
gen	41:16	And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall
gen	41:17	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon
gen	41:22	And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one
gen	41:25	And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God
gen	41:26	The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are
gen	41:27	And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them
gen	41:28	This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is
gen	41:29	Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all
gen	41:32	And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is
gen	41:33	Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and
gen	41:34	Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land,
gen	41:35	And let them gather all the food of those good years that come,
gen	41:36	And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven
gen	41:37	And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes
gen	41:38	And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as
gen	41:41	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the
gen	41:42	And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon
gen	41:44	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee
gen	41:45	And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave
gen	41:46	And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh
gen	41:47	And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by
gen	41:48	And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were
gen	41:49	And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much,
gen	41:50	And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine
gen	41:51	And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God,
gen	41:52	And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath
gen	41:53	And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of
gen	41:54	And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph
gen	41:55	And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to
gen	41:56	And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph
gen	41:57	And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn;
gen	42:1	Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto
gen	42:3	And Joseph’s ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.
gen	42:4	But Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren;
gen	42:5	And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came:
gen	42:6	And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that
gen	42:7	And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself
gen	42:8	And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.
gen	42:9	And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and
gen	42:10	And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy
gen	42:11	We are all one man’s sons; we are true men, thy servants are no
gen	42:12	And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land
gen	42:13	And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one
gen	42:14	And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you,
gen	42:16	Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be
gen	42:17	And he put them all together into ward three days.
gen	42:18	And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for
gen	42:21	And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning
gen	42:22	And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying,
gen	42:23	And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto
gen	42:24	And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to
gen	42:25	Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to
gen	42:26	And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.
gen	42:27	And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in
gen	42:28	And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it
gen	42:31	And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies: 42:32 We
gen	42:33	And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall
gen	42:35	And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold,
gen	42:36	And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my
gen	42:37	And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I
gen	42:38	And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother
gen	43:1	And the famine was sore in the land.
gen	43:2	And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they
gen	43:3	And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest
gen	43:4	If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy
gen	43:6	And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell
gen	43:9	I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I
gen	43:11	And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do
gen	43:15	And the men took that present, and they took double money in
gen	43:16	And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of
gen	43:17	And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into
gen	43:18	And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph’s
gen	43:19	And they came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they
gen	43:22	And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food:
gen	43:23	And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of
gen	43:24	And the man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave them
gen	43:25	And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for
gen	43:26	And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which
gen	43:27	And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father
gen	43:29	And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his
gen	43:30	And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his
gen	43:31	And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and
gen	43:32	And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves,
gen	43:33	And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his
gen	43:34	And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but
gen	44:1	And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men’s
gen	44:2	And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the
gen	44:3	As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they
gen	44:4	And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off,
gen	44:6	And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.
gen	44:7	And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God
gen	44:10	And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he
gen	44:11	Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground,
gen	44:12	And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the
gen	44:13	Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and
gen	44:14	And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house; for he was
gen	44:15	And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done?
gen	44:17	And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in
gen	44:18	Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy
gen	44:19	My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a
gen	44:21	And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that
gen	44:22	And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for
gen	44:23	And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother
gen	44:24	And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father,
gen	44:25	And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.
gen	44:26	And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with
gen	44:27	And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife
gen	44:30	Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad
gen	44:31	It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with
gen	44:32	For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father,
gen	44:33	Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the
gen	44:34	For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me?
gen	45:1	Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood
gen	45:2	And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh
gen	45:3	And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father
gen	45:4	And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you.
gen	45:5	Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye
gen	45:6	For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet
gen	45:7	And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the
gen	45:8	So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath
gen	45:9	Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith
gen	45:12	And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin,
gen	45:13	And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all
gen	45:14	And he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck, and wept; and
gen	45:15	Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and
gen	45:16	And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying,
gen	45:17	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye;
gen	45:19	Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the
gen	45:20	Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of
gen	45:21	And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons,
gen	45:22	To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to
gen	45:23	And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden
gen	45:24	So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said
gen	45:25	And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan
gen	45:27	And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said
gen	46:1	And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to
gen	46:2	And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said,
gen	46:3	And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down
gen	46:5	And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried
gen	46:6	And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had
gen	46:8	And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came
gen	46:9	And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and
gen	46:10	And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin,
gen	46:11	And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
gen	46:12	And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and
gen	46:13	And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and
gen	46:14	And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.
gen	46:15	These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in
gen	46:16	And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri,
gen	46:17	And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah,
gen	46:18	These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his
gen	46:19	The sons of Rachel Jacob’s wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.
gen	46:20	And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and
gen	46:21	And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel,
gen	46:22	These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the
gen	46:23	And the sons of Dan; Hushim.
gen	46:24	And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and
gen	46:25	These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his
gen	46:26	All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of
gen	46:28	And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face
gen	46:29	And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel
gen	46:30	And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen
gen	46:31	And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father’s house,
gen	46:32	And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed
gen	46:33	And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and
gen	47:1	Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my
gen	47:2	And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented
gen	47:3	And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And
gen	47:4	They said morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we
gen	47:5	And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy
gen	47:7	And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before
gen	47:8	And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou? 47:9 And Jacob
gen	47:10	And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.
gen	47:11	And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a
gen	47:12	And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his
gen	47:13	And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very
gen	47:14	And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land
gen	47:15	And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of
gen	47:16	And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your
gen	47:17	And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them
gen	47:18	When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year,
gen	47:19	Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land?
gen	47:20	And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the
gen	47:21	And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of
gen	47:22	Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had
gen	47:23	Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this
gen	47:24	And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give
gen	47:25	And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in
gen	47:26	And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day,
gen	47:27	And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen;
gen	47:28	And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the
gen	47:29	And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his
gen	47:31	And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel
gen	48:1	And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph,
gen	48:2	And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto
gen	48:3	And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz
gen	48:5	And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto
gen	48:6	And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine,
gen	48:7	And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the
gen	48:8	And Israel beheld Joseph’s sons, and said, Who are these? 48:9
gen	48:10	Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not
gen	48:11	And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face:
gen	48:12	And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed
gen	48:13	And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward
gen	48:14	And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon
gen	48:15	And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers
gen	48:17	And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the
gen	48:18	And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is
gen	48:19	And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it:
gen	48:20	And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel
gen	48:21	And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be
gen	48:22	Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren,
gen	49:1	And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves
gen	49:2	Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and
gen	49:3	Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my
gen	49:5	Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their
gen	49:6	O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly,
gen	49:7	Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it
gen	49:8	Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall
gen	49:9	Judah is a lion’s whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up:
gen	49:11	Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass’s colt unto the
gen	49:13	Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for
gen	49:14	Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:
gen	49:15	And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was
gen	49:16	Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.
gen	49:17	Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that
gen	49:18	I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.
gen	49:19	Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the
gen	49:20	Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal
gen	49:21	Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.
gen	49:22	Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well;
gen	49:27	Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour
gen	49:28	All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that
gen	49:29	And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered
gen	49:31	There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried
gen	49:32	The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was
gen	49:33	And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he
gen	50:1	And Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept upon him, and
gen	50:2	And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his
gen	50:3	And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the
gen	50:4	And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto
gen	50:6	And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he
gen	50:7	And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all
gen	50:9	And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was
gen	50:10	And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond
gen	50:11	And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the
gen	50:12	And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them: 50:13
gen	50:14	And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all
gen	50:15	And when Joseph’s brethren saw that their father was dead, they
gen	50:16	And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did
gen	50:18	And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and
gen	50:19	And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of
gen	50:21	Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little
gen	50:22	And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father’s house: and
gen	50:23	And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the third generation: the
gen	50:24	And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely
gen	50:25	And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God
gen	50:26	So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they
exo	1:1	Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came
exo	1:2	Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 1:3 Issachar, Zebulun, and
exo	1:5	And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy
exo	1:6	And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.
exo	1:7	And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased
exo	1:8	Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.
exo	1:9	And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of
exo	1:11	Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with
exo	1:12	But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and
exo	1:13	And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with
exo	1:15	And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the
exo	1:17	But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt
exo	1:18	And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto
exo	1:20	Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people
exo	1:21	And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he
exo	1:22	And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is
exo	2:1	And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a
exo	2:2	And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that
exo	2:3	And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of
exo	2:4	And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.
exo	2:5	And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the
exo	2:6	And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the
exo	2:7	Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call to
exo	2:9	And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and
exo	2:10	And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter,
exo	2:11	And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he
exo	2:12	And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there
exo	2:13	And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the
exo	2:15	Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But
exo	2:16	Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and
exo	2:17	And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up
exo	2:18	And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that
exo	2:20	And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that
exo	2:21	And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses
exo	2:22	And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he
exo	2:23	And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt
exo	2:24	And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant
exo	2:25	And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect
exo	3:1	Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest
exo	3:2	And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out
exo	3:3	And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight,
exo	3:4	And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto
exo	3:5	And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy
exo	3:6	Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham,
exo	3:7	And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people
exo	3:9	Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come
exo	3:10	Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou
exo	3:11	And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh,
exo	3:12	And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a
exo	3:13	And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of
exo	3:15	And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the
exo	3:16	Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them,
exo	3:18	And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou
exo	3:19	And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not
exo	3:20	And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my
exo	3:21	And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians:
exo	3:22	But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that
exo	4:1	And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe
exo	4:2	And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he
exo	4:3	And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground,
exo	4:4	And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by
exo	4:6	And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into
exo	4:7	And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his
exo	4:8	And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither
exo	4:9	And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two
exo	4:10	And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent,
exo	4:11	And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man’s mouth? or who
exo	4:13	And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him
exo	4:14	And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said,
exo	4:15	And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I
exo	4:16	And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be,
exo	4:17	And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt
exo	4:18	And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said
exo	4:19	And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt:
exo	4:20	And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass,
exo	4:21	And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into
exo	4:22	And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is
exo	4:24	And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him,
exo	4:25	Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her
exo	4:26	So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art,
exo	4:27	And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.
exo	4:28	And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him,
exo	4:29	And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of
exo	4:31	And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had
exo	5:1	And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus
exo	5:2	And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to
exo	5:3	And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go,
exo	5:4	And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and
exo	5:5	And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and
exo	5:6	And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people,
exo	5:8	And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye
exo	5:9	Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour
exo	5:10	And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers,
exo	5:11	Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your
exo	5:12	So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of
exo	5:13	And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your
exo	5:14	And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh’s
exo	5:17	But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us
exo	5:18	Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given
exo	5:19	And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were
exo	5:20	And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came
exo	5:22	And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore hast
exo	5:23	For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done
exo	6:1	Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do
exo	6:2	And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD: 6:3
exo	6:4	And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them
exo	6:5	And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom
exo	6:6	Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I
exo	6:8	And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did
exo	6:9	And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened
exo	6:10	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:11 Go in, speak unto
exo	6:12	And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of
exo	6:14	These be the heads of their fathers’ houses: The sons of Reuben
exo	6:15	And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin,
exo	6:16	And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their
exo	6:17	The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their
exo	6:18	And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel:
exo	6:19	And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the families
exo	6:20	And Amram took him Jochebed his father’s sister to wife; and she
exo	6:21	And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.
exo	6:22	And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.
exo	6:23	And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of
exo	6:24	And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these
exo	6:25	And Eleazar Aaron’s son took him one of the daughters of Putiel
exo	6:26	These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out
exo	6:27	These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out
exo	6:28	And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses in
exo	6:30	And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised
exo	7:2	Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother
exo	7:3	And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply my signs and my
exo	7:4	But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand
exo	7:5	And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch
exo	7:6	And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.
exo	7:7	And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three
exo	7:8	And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 7:9 When
exo	7:10	And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the
exo	7:11	Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the
exo	7:12	For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents:
exo	7:13	And he hardened Pharaoh’s heart, that he hearkened not unto them;
exo	7:14	And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh’s heart is hardened, he
exo	7:15	Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the
exo	7:16	And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath
exo	7:17	Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD:
exo	7:18	And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall
exo	7:19	And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and
exo	7:20	And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted
exo	7:21	And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and
exo	7:22	And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and
exo	7:23	And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set
exo	7:24	And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to
exo	7:25	And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten
exo	8:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him,
exo	8:2	And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy
exo	8:4	And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and
exo	8:5	And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine
exo	8:6	And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the
exo	8:7	And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up
exo	8:8	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the
exo	8:9	And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat
exo	8:11	And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and
exo	8:12	And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto
exo	8:13	And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs
exo	8:14	And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.
exo	8:15	But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his
exo	8:16	And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy
exo	8:17	And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod,
exo	8:18	And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth
exo	8:19	Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God:
exo	8:20	And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and
exo	8:21	Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send
exo	8:22	And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my
exo	8:23	And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to
exo	8:24	And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies
exo	8:25	And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye,
exo	8:26	And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice
exo	8:28	And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the
exo	8:29	And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat
exo	8:30	And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.
exo	8:31	And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed
exo	8:32	And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would
exo	9:1	Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him,
exo	9:2	For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, 9:3
exo	9:4	And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the
exo	9:5	And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD
exo	9:6	And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of
exo	9:7	And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of
exo	9:8	And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls
exo	9:9	And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall
exo	9:10	And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and
exo	9:11	And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the
exo	9:12	And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not
exo	9:13	And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and
exo	9:14	For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and
exo	9:15	For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy
exo	9:16	And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to
exo	9:17	As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt
exo	9:19	Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast
exo	9:20	He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh
exo	9:22	And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward
exo	9:23	And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD
exo	9:24	So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous,
exo	9:25	And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was
exo	9:26	Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were,
exo	9:27	And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto
exo	9:28	Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty
exo	9:29	And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I
exo	9:30	But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet
exo	9:31	And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in
exo	9:32	But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not
exo	9:33	And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad
exo	9:34	And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders
exo	9:35	And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the
exo	10:1	And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have
exo	10:3	And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus
exo	10:4	Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will
exo	10:7	And Pharaoh’s servants said unto him, How long shall this man be
exo	10:10	And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will
exo	10:11	Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye
exo	10:12	And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the
exo	10:13	And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and
exo	10:14	And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in
exo	10:15	For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land
exo	10:16	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I
exo	10:17	Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and
exo	10:18	And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.
exo	10:19	And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away
exo	10:20	But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, so that he would not let
exo	10:21	And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward
exo	10:22	And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was
exo	10:24	And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD;
exo	10:25	And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt
exo	10:26	Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be
exo	10:27	But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let them
exo	10:28	And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to
exo	10:29	And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again
exo	11:1	And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more
exo	11:2	Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of
exo	11:3	And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the
exo	11:4	And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out
exo	11:6	And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt,
exo	11:7	But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move
exo	11:8	And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down
exo	11:9	And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you;
exo	11:10	And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and
exo	12:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt
exo	12:3	Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the
exo	12:5	Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye
exo	12:7	And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side
exo	12:8	And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and
exo	12:9	Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with
exo	12:10	And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and
exo	12:11	And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on
exo	12:12	For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will
exo	12:13	And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where
exo	12:14	And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep
exo	12:15	Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye
exo	12:16	And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in
exo	12:17	And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this
exo	12:18	In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even,
exo	12:19	Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for
exo	12:20	Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye
exo	12:21	Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto
exo	12:22	And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood
exo	12:23	For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when
exo	12:24	And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to
exo	12:25	And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the
exo	12:26	And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto
exo	12:28	And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had
exo	12:29	And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the
exo	12:30	And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and
exo	12:31	And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up,
exo	12:32	Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be
exo	12:33	And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might
exo	12:34	And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their
exo	12:35	And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses;
exo	12:37	And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth,
exo	12:38	And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and
exo	12:39	And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought
exo	12:40	Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in
exo	12:41	And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty
exo	12:42	It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing
exo	12:43	And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of
exo	12:45	A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.
exo	12:46	In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought
exo	12:47	All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.
exo	12:48	And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the
exo	12:49	One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger
exo	12:50	Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses
exo	12:51	And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring
exo	13:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 13:2 Sanctify unto me all
exo	13:3	And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye
exo	13:4	This day came ye out in the month Abib.
exo	13:5	And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of
exo	13:6	Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh
exo	13:7	Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no
exo	13:8	And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done
exo	13:9	And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a
exo	13:10	Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year
exo	13:11	And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of
exo	13:13	And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and
exo	13:14	And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come,
exo	13:15	And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that
exo	13:16	And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets
exo	13:17	And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that
exo	13:19	And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly
exo	13:20	And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham,
exo	13:21	And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to
exo	14:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 14:2 Speak unto the
exo	14:3	For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are
exo	14:4	And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, that he shall follow after
exo	14:5	And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the
exo	14:8	And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he
exo	14:9	But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots
exo	14:10	And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up
exo	14:11	And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt,
exo	14:13	And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and
exo	14:14	The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.
exo	14:15	And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me?
exo	14:17	And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and
exo	14:18	And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have
exo	14:19	And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel,
exo	14:21	And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD
exo	14:22	And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon
exo	14:23	And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst
exo	14:24	And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked
exo	14:26	And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the
exo	14:27	And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea
exo	14:28	And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the
exo	14:29	But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of
exo	14:30	Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the
exo	14:31	And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the
exo	15:1	Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the
exo	15:2	The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation:
exo	15:3	The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.
exo	15:4	Pharaoh’s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his
exo	15:5	The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a
exo	15:6	Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right
exo	15:7	And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown
exo	15:8	And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered
exo	15:9	The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the
exo	15:10	Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank
exo	15:11	Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee,
exo	15:13	Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast
exo	15:14	The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on
exo	15:15	Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab,
exo	15:16	Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine
exo	15:17	Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of
exo	15:18	The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.
exo	15:19	For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his
exo	15:20	And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel
exo	15:21	And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath
exo	15:22	So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into
exo	15:23	And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters
exo	15:24	And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we
exo	15:27	And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and
exo	16:1	And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation
exo	16:2	And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured
exo	16:4	Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from
exo	16:5	And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall
exo	16:6	And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At
exo	16:9	And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the
exo	16:10	And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation
exo	16:11	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 16:12 I have heard the
exo	16:13	And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and
exo	16:14	And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of
exo	16:15	And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to
exo	16:16	This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it
exo	16:17	And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some
exo	16:18	And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much
exo	16:19	And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.
exo	16:20	Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them
exo	16:21	And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his
exo	16:22	And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice
exo	16:23	And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To
exo	16:24	And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did
exo	16:25	And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto
exo	16:26	Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is
exo	16:27	And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on
exo	16:28	And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my
exo	16:30	So the people rested on the seventh day.
exo	16:31	And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it
exo	16:32	And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth,
exo	16:33	And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of
exo	16:34	As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the
exo	16:35	And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they
exo	16:36	Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.
exo	17:1	And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from
exo	17:2	Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us
exo	17:5	And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take
exo	17:6	Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb;
exo	17:7	And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because
exo	17:9	And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight
exo	17:10	So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek:
exo	17:11	And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel
exo	17:12	But Moses’ hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it
exo	17:13	And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of
exo	17:14	And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a
exo	17:15	And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it
exo	18:1	When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father in law, heard of
exo	18:3	And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for
exo	18:7	And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance,
exo	18:8	And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto
exo	18:9	And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done
exo	18:10	And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out
exo	18:11	Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the
exo	18:12	And Jethro, Moses’ father in law, took a burnt offering and
exo	18:13	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the
exo	18:14	And when Moses’ father in law saw all that he did to the people,
exo	18:17	And Moses’ father in law said unto him, The thing that thou
exo	18:18	Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is
exo	18:19	Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God
exo	18:21	Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such
exo	18:23	If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou
exo	18:24	So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did
exo	18:25	And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads
exo	18:26	And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they
exo	18:27	And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into
exo	19:1	In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth
exo	19:2	For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert
exo	19:3	And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of
exo	19:5	Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my
exo	19:7	And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid
exo	19:8	And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD
exo	19:9	And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick
exo	19:10	And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify
exo	19:12	And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying,
exo	19:14	And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and
exo	19:15	And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day:
exo	19:16	And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there
exo	19:17	And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with
exo	19:18	And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD
exo	19:19	And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder
exo	19:20	And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the
exo	19:21	And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest

exo	21:10	If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty
exo	21:11	And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out

exo	21:33	And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and
exo	21:35	And if one man’s ox hurt another’s, that he die; then they shall
exo	21:36	Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past,
exo	22:1	If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it;
exo	22:2	If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die,
exo	22:3	If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him;
exo	22:4	If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be

exo	23:7	Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous
exo	23:8	And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and
exo	23:9	Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of

exo	32:1	And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of
exo	32:2	And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which
exo	32:3	And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in
exo	32:4	And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a
exo	32:5	And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron
exo	32:6	And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt
exo	32:7	And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people,
exo	32:9	And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and,
exo	32:11	And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth
exo	32:12	Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did
exo	32:13	Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou
exo	32:14	And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto
exo	32:15	And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two
exo	32:16	And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the
exo	32:17	And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted,
exo	32:18	And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery,
exo	32:19	And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that
exo	32:20	And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the
exo	32:21	And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that
exo	32:23	For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us:
exo	32:24	And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it
exo	32:25	And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had
exo	32:27	And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put
exo	32:28	And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and
exo	32:29	For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD,
exo	32:30	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the
exo	32:31	And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have
exo	32:32	Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me,
exo	32:33	And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me,
exo	32:34	Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have
exo	32:35	And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf,
exo	33:1	And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and
exo	33:4	And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and
exo	33:5	For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of
exo	33:6	And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments
exo	33:7	And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp,
exo	33:8	And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle,
exo	33:9	And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the
exo	33:10	And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle
exo	33:11	And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh
exo	33:12	And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up
exo	33:13	Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight,
exo	33:14	And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give
exo	33:15	And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us
exo	33:16	For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have
exo	33:17	And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that
exo	33:18	And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.
exo	33:19	And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I
exo	33:20	And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man
exo	33:21	And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou
exo	34:1	And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like
exo	34:2	And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto
exo	34:3	And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen
exo	34:4	And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses
exo	34:5	And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there,
exo	34:6	And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The
exo	34:8	And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and
exo	34:9	And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD, let
exo	34:10	And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I
exo	34:11	Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive
exo	34:12	Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the
exo	34:15	Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and
exo	34:17	Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.
exo	34:18	The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou
exo	34:19	All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among
exo	34:20	But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and
exo	34:21	Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt
exo	34:22	And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of
exo	34:23	Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the
exo	34:24	For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy
exo	34:25	Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven;
exo	34:26	The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto
exo	34:27	And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after
exo	34:28	And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he
exo	34:29	And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with
exo	34:30	And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold,
exo	34:31	And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the
exo	34:32	And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave
exo	34:33	And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his
exo	34:34	But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he
exo	34:35	And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin
exo	35:1	And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel
exo	35:2	Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall
exo	35:3	Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the
exo	35:4	And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of

lev	6:21	In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou
lev	6:22	And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall
lev	6:23	For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it
lev	6:24	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:25 Speak unto Aaron and
lev	6:26	The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy
lev	6:27	Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when
lev	6:28	But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and
lev	6:29	All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most
lev	6:30	And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the
lev	7:1	Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most
lev	7:2	In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill
lev	7:3	And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the
lev	7:6	Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten
lev	7:7	As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one
lev	7:8	And the priest that offereth any man’s burnt offering, even the
lev	7:9	And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that
lev	7:10	And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the
lev	7:11	And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he
lev	7:12	If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the
lev	7:13	Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread
lev	7:14	And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an
lev	7:15	And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for
lev	7:16	But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary
lev	7:17	But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day
lev	7:18	And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings
lev	7:19	And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten;
lev	7:20	But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace
lev	7:21	Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the
lev	7:22	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 7:23 Speak unto the
lev	7:24	And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of
lev	7:25	For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an
lev	7:26	Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl
lev	7:27	Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that
lev	7:28	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 7:29 Speak unto the
lev	7:30	His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire,
lev	7:31	And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast
lev	7:32	And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave
lev	7:33	He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace
lev	7:34	For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the
lev	7:35	This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the
lev	7:37	This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and
lev	8:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 8:2 Take Aaron and his sons
lev	8:4	And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was
lev	8:5	And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which the
lev	8:6	And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.
lev	8:7	And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and
lev	8:8	And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the
lev	8:9	And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even upon
lev	8:10	And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and
lev	8:11	And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed
lev	8:12	And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head, and
lev	8:13	And Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and put coats upon them, and
lev	8:14	And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and
lev	8:15	And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the
lev	8:16	And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul
lev	8:17	But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt
lev	8:18	And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his
lev	8:19	And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar
lev	8:20	And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the
lev	8:21	And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt
lev	8:22	And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron
lev	8:23	And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it
lev	8:24	And he brought Aaron’s sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the
lev	8:25	And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon
lev	8:28	And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the
lev	8:29	And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering
lev	8:30	And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was
lev	8:31	And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the
lev	8:32	And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye
lev	8:33	And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the
lev	8:34	As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to
lev	8:35	Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the
lev	8:36	So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by
lev	9:1	And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and
lev	9:3	And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye
lev	9:5	And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle
lev	9:6	And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye
lev	9:7	And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin
lev	9:8	Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin
lev	9:9	And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped
lev	9:11	And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.
lev	9:12	And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons presented unto
lev	9:13	And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces
lev	9:14	And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the
lev	9:15	And he brought the people’s offering, and took the goat, which
lev	9:16	And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to
lev	9:17	And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof,
lev	9:18	He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace
lev	9:20	And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon
lev	9:22	And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them,
lev	9:23	And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation,
lev	9:24	And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon
lev	10:1	And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his
lev	10:2	And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and
lev	10:3	Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake,
lev	10:4	And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the
lev	10:5	So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the
lev	10:6	And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his
lev	10:7	And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the
lev	10:8	And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying, 10:9 Do not drink wine nor
lev	10:12	And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar,
lev	10:14	And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean
lev	10:15	The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the
lev	10:16	And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and,
lev	10:19	And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered
lev	11:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,
lev	11:2	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts
lev	11:3	Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the
lev	11:4	Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or

lev	11:25	And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash
lev	11:26	The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not
lev	11:27	And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts
lev	11:28	And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes,

lev	11:35	And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth
lev	11:36	Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of

lev	11:41	And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be
lev	11:42	Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all
lev	11:43	Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing
lev	11:44	For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify

lev	20:3	And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off
lev	20:4	And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from
lev	20:5	Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family,

lev	20:7	Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD
lev	20:8	And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD which
lev	20:9	For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be
lev	20:10	And the man that committeth adultery with another man’s wife,
lev	20:11	And the man that lieth with his father’s wife hath uncovered his
lev	20:12	And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall
lev	20:13	If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both
lev	20:14	And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they
lev	20:15	And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death:
lev	20:16	And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto,
lev	20:17	And if a man shall take his sister, his father’s daughter, or
lev	20:18	And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and
lev	20:19	And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister,
lev	20:20	And if a man shall lie with his uncle’s wife, he hath uncovered
lev	20:21	And if a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is an unclean
lev	20:22	Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments,
lev	20:23	And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast
lev	20:24	But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I
lev	20:25	Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and
lev	20:26	And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have
lev	20:27	A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a

lev	21:6	They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of
lev	21:7	They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither
lev	21:8	Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of

lev	21:23	Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the
lev	21:24	And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the

lev	22:20	But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it
lev	22:21	And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the
lev	22:22	Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or
lev	22:23	Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or

lev	22:29	And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the
lev	22:30	On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it
lev	22:31	Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the
lev	22:32	Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed
lev	23:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 23:2 Speak unto the
lev	23:3	Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath
lev	23:4	These are the feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations, which
lev	23:5	In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD’s

lev	23:28	And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of
lev	23:29	For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that
lev	23:30	And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day,
lev	23:31	Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever
lev	23:32	It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict

lev	23:44	And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the
lev	24:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 24:2 Command the children
lev	24:3	Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the
lev	24:4	He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the
lev	24:5	And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof:

lev	24:11	And the Israelitish woman’s son blasphemed the name of the Lord,
lev	24:13	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 24:14 Bring forth him
lev	24:15	And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying,
lev	24:16	And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be
lev	24:17	And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.
lev	24:18	And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast.
lev	24:19	And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done,
lev	24:21	And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that
lev	24:22	Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as
lev	24:23	And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should

lev	25:7	And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land, shall
lev	25:8	And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven
lev	25:9	Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the
lev	25:10	And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty
lev	25:11	A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow,
lev	25:12	For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat
lev	25:13	In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his
lev	25:14	And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of
lev	25:17	Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear
lev	25:18	Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do
lev	25:19	And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill,
lev	25:20	And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold,
lev	25:22	And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until
lev	25:23	The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for
lev	25:24	And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a
lev	25:25	If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his
lev	25:26	And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to
lev	25:28	But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is
lev	25:29	And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may
lev	25:30	And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then
lev	25:31	But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about
lev	25:32	Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the
lev	25:33	And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was
lev	25:34	But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold;
lev	25:35	And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee;
lev	25:36	Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that
lev	25:37	Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy
lev	25:38	I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land
lev	25:39	And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be
lev	25:40	But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with
lev	25:41	And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children
lev	25:42	For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land
lev	25:43	Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy
lev	25:44	Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have,
lev	25:45	Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among
lev	25:46	And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after
lev	25:47	And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother
lev	25:50	And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that
lev	25:51	If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall
lev	25:52	And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then
lev	25:53	And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the
lev	25:54	And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out
lev	25:55	For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my
lev	26:1	Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up
lev	26:2	Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the
lev	26:3	If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;
lev	26:4	Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield
lev	26:5	And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage
lev	26:6	And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and
lev	26:7	And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you
lev	26:8	And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you
lev	26:9	For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and
lev	26:10	And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of
lev	26:11	And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor
lev	26:12	And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be
lev	26:13	I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land
lev	26:14	But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these
lev	26:17	And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before
lev	26:18	And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will
lev	26:19	And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your
lev	26:21	And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I
lev	26:22	I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of
lev	26:23	And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will
lev	26:25	And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel
lev	26:26	And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall
lev	26:27	And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk
lev	26:29	And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your
lev	26:30	And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images,
lev	26:31	And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries
lev	26:32	And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies
lev	26:33	And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a
lev	26:34	Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth
lev	26:35	As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not
lev	26:36	And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness
lev	26:37	And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword,
lev	26:38	And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your
lev	26:39	And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity
lev	26:40	If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their
lev	26:43	The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her
lev	26:44	And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies,
lev	26:45	But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their
lev	26:46	These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD
lev	27:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 27:2 Speak unto the
lev	27:3	And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old
lev	27:4	And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty
lev	27:5	And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then
lev	27:6	And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy
lev	27:7	And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male,
lev	27:8	But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present
lev	27:9	And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the
lev	27:10	He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad
lev	27:11	And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a
lev	27:13	But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part
lev	27:14	And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the
lev	27:15	And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he
lev	27:16	And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field
lev	27:17	If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to
lev	27:18	But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest
lev	27:19	And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it,
lev	27:20	And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the
lev	27:21	But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy
lev	27:22	And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath
lev	27:24	In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of
lev	27:25	And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the
lev	27:26	Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD’s
lev	27:27	And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it
lev	27:28	Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto
lev	27:29	None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed;
lev	27:30	And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land,
lev	27:31	And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall

num	10:29	And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite,
num	10:30	And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine
num	10:31	And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou

num	10:33	And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days’
num	10:34	And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went
num	10:35	And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said,
num	10:36	And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many
num	11:1	And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the
num	11:2	And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the
num	11:3	And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of
num	11:4	And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and
num	11:7	And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as
num	11:8	And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in
num	11:9	And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell
num	11:10	Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families,
num	11:11	And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy
num	11:14	I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too
num	11:15	And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of
num	11:16	And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the
num	11:17	And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take
num	11:18	And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to
num	11:19	Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither
num	11:22	Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice
num	11:24	And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD,
num	11:25	And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took
num	11:26	But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the
num	11:27	And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and
num	11:28	And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his
num	11:29	And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God
num	11:31	And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails
num	11:32	And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and
num	11:33	And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was
num	11:34	And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because
num	11:35	And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth;
num	12:1	And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian
num	12:2	And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he
num	12:3	(Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were
num	12:5	And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in
num	12:6	And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you,
num	12:7	My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.
num	12:8	With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in
num	12:9	And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he
num	12:10	And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold,
num	12:11	And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay
num	12:12	Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed
num	12:13	And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I
num	12:14	And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her
num	12:15	And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people
num	12:16	And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in
num	13:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 13:2 Send thou men, that
num	13:3	And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the
num	13:4	And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the
num	13:5	Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.

num	13:16	These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the
num	13:17	And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto
num	13:18	And see the land, what it is, and the people that dwelleth
num	13:21	So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of
num	13:22	And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where
num	13:24	The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of
num	13:25	And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.
num	13:26	And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the
num	13:27	And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou
num	13:28	Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and
num	13:29	The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites,
num	13:30	And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go
num	13:31	But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up
num	13:32	And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had
num	13:33	And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the
num	14:1	And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and
num	14:2	And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against
num	14:5	Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly
num	14:6	And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which
num	14:8	If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land,
num	14:9	Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of
num	14:10	But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the
num	14:11	And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke
num	14:13	And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it,
num	14:14	And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they
num	14:15	Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the
num	14:17	And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my LORD be great,
num	14:19	Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according
num	14:20	And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word: 14:21
num	14:22	Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles,
num	14:25	(Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.)
num	14:26	And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 14:27 How
num	14:28	Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have
num	14:30	Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I
num	14:31	But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will
num	14:32	But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this
num	14:33	And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years,
num	14:34	After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even
num	14:35	I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil
num	14:36	And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned,
num	14:38	But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which
num	14:39	And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel:
num	14:40	And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the
num	14:41	And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment
num	14:42	Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten
num	14:43	For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and
num	14:44	But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the
num	14:45	Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in
num	15:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 15:2 Speak unto the
num	15:4	Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a
num	15:5	And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt
num	15:6	Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth
num	15:7	And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an
num	15:8	And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a
num	15:10	And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine,
num	15:11	Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a
num	15:12	According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to
num	15:13	All that are born of the country shall do these things after
num	15:14	And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you in
num	15:15	One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and
num	15:16	One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger
num	15:17	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 15:18 Speak unto the
num	15:20	Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave
num	15:21	Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave
num	15:22	And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments,
num	15:25	And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation
num	15:27	And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she
num	15:28	And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth
num	15:29	Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance,
num	15:30	But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born
num	15:31	Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken
num	15:32	And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they
num	15:33	And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses
num	15:34	And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what
num	15:35	And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to
num	15:36	And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and
num	15:37	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 15:38 Speak unto the
num	15:41	I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of
num	16:1	Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi,
num	16:6	This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company; 16:7 And
num	16:8	And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:
num	16:9	Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel
num	16:15	And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not
num	16:16	And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before
num	16:18	And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and
num	16:19	And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the
num	16:20	And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 16:21
num	16:22	And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the
num	16:24	Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the
num	16:25	And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the
num	16:26	And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you,
num	16:27	So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram,
num	16:28	And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me
num	16:29	If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be
num	16:30	But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth,
num	16:31	And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these
num	16:33	They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the
num	16:34	And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of
num	16:35	And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two

num	16:43	And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the
num	16:44	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 16:45 Get you up from
num	16:46	And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein
num	16:47	And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the
num	16:48	And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was
num	16:49	Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and
num	16:50	And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of
num	17:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 17:2 Speak unto the
num	17:3	And thou shalt write Aaron’s name upon the rod of Levi: for one
num	17:4	And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation
num	17:5	And it shall come to pass, that the man’s rod, whom I shall

num	17:7	And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of
num	17:8	And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the
num	17:9	And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all
num	17:10	And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron’s rod again before the
num	17:11	And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.
num	17:12	And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we
num	17:13	Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD
num	18:2	And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy

num	18:22	Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the
num	18:23	But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the
num	18:24	But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an

num	19:4	And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger,
num	19:7	Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his

num	20:1	Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,
num	20:2	And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered
num	20:3	And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God
num	20:6	And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto
num	20:7	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 20:8 Take the rod, and
num	20:9	And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.
num	20:10	And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before
num	20:12	And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me
num	20:13	This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel
num	20:14	And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom,
num	20:18	And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come
num	20:19	And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high
num	20:20	And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out
num	20:21	Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border:
num	20:22	And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,
num	20:23	And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the
num	20:25	Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount
num	20:27	And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount
num	20:28	And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon
num	20:29	And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they
num	21:1	And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard
num	21:2	And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt
num	21:3	And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up
num	21:4	And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to
num	21:5	And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore
num	21:6	And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit
num	21:7	Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for
num	21:8	And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set
num	21:9	And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it
num	21:10	And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.
num	21:11	And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the
num	21:12	From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.
num	21:13	From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of
num	21:14	Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What
num	21:16	And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the
num	21:17	Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:
num	21:18	The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it,
num	21:21	And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites,
num	21:23	And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border:
num	21:24	And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed
num	21:25	And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the
num	21:26	For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who
num	21:27	Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon,
num	21:29	Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath
num	21:30	We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and
num	21:31	Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
num	21:32	And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages
num	21:33	And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the
num	21:34	And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered
num	21:35	So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there
num	22:1	And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains
num	22:2	And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the
num	22:3	And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many:
num	22:4	And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company
num	22:5	He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to
num	22:7	And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the
num	22:8	And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring
num	22:9	And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?
num	22:10	And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab,
num	22:12	And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou
num	22:13	And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of
num	22:14	And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and
num	22:15	And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than
num	22:16	And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the
num	22:18	And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If
num	22:19	Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I
num	22:20	And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men
num	22:21	And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went
num	22:22	And God’s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of
num	22:23	And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and
num	22:24	But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a
num	22:25	And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself
num	22:26	And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow
num	22:27	And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under
num	22:28	And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto
num	22:30	And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which
num	22:31	Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of
num	22:32	And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou
num	22:34	And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I
num	22:35	And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but
num	22:36	And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet
num	22:37	And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee
num	22:39	And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.
num	22:40	And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the
num	22:41	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and
num	23:1	And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and
num	23:2	And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered
num	23:3	And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I
num	23:4	And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven
num	23:5	And the LORD put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, Return unto
num	23:6	And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt
num	23:7	And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath
num	23:8	How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy,
num	23:10	Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth
num	23:12	And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that
num	23:14	And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of
num	23:15	And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while
num	23:16	And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said,
num	23:17	And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering,
num	23:21	He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen
num	23:22	God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength
num	23:23	Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there
num	23:25	And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless
num	23:26	But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee,
num	23:28	And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh
num	23:29	And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and
num	23:30	And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a
num	24:1	And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he
num	24:2	And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his
num	24:3	And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath
num	24:7	He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be
num	24:8	God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the
num	24:9	He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall
num	24:10	And Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his
num	24:11	Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee
num	24:12	And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers
num	24:15	And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor
num	24:18	And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession
num	24:19	Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall
num	24:20	And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said,
num	24:21	And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said,
num	24:22	Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall
num	24:23	And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when
num	24:25	And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and
num	25:1	And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit
num	25:2	And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and
num	25:3	And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor: and the anger of the
num	25:4	And the LORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people,
num	25:5	And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his

deu	9:19	For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the
deu	9:20	And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and
deu	9:21	And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it
deu	9:22	And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye

deu	28:62	And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars
deu	28:63	And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to
deu	28:64	And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one
deu	28:65	And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall
deu	28:68	And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by
deu	29:1	These are the words of the covenant, which the LORD commanded
deu	29:2	And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have
deu	29:5	And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes
deu	29:6	Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong
deu	29:7	And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and
deu	29:9	Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye
deu	29:10	Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your
deu	29:14	Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;
deu	29:15	But with him that standeth here with us this day before the LORD
deu	29:21	And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes
deu	29:28	And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in
deu	29:29	The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things
deu	30:1	And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon
deu	30:4	If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven,
deu	30:6	And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart
deu	30:7	And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine
deu	30:8	And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do all
deu	30:9	And the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of
deu	30:11	For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not
deu	30:12	It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up
deu	30:15	See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death
deu	30:17	But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but
deu	30:19	I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I

deu	31:2	And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this
deu	31:3	The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will
deu	31:4	And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og,
deu	31:5	And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may do
deu	31:6	Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them:
deu	31:7	And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of
deu	31:8	And the LORD, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with
deu	31:9	And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the
deu	31:10	And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven
deu	31:12	Gather the people together, men and women, and children, and thy
deu	31:14	And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that
deu	31:15	And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud:
deu	31:16	And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy
deu	31:17	Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I
deu	31:19	Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the
deu	31:20	For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware
deu	31:21	And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are
deu	31:22	Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the
deu	31:23	And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong
deu	31:24	And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the
deu	31:27	For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am
deu	31:29	For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt
deu	31:30	And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel
deu	32:1	Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the
deu	32:2	My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the
deu	32:4	He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are

deu	32:6	Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not
deu	32:8	When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when
deu	32:9	For the LORD’s portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his
deu	32:10	He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling
deu	32:11	As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young,
deu	32:12	So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god
deu	32:13	He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might
deu	32:15	But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art
deu	32:16	They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with
deu	32:17	They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew
deu	32:18	Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast
deu	32:19	And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the
deu	32:20	And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what
deu	32:21	They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they
deu	32:22	For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the
deu	32:23	I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon
deu	32:24	They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,
deu	32:25	The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the
deu	32:26	I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the
deu	32:28	For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any
deu	32:29	O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they
deu	32:32	For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of
deu	32:33	Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of
deu	32:34	Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my
deu	32:36	For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his
deu	32:37	And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they
deu	32:39	See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I
deu	32:40	For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.
deu	32:41	If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on
deu	32:42	I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall
deu	32:43	Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the
deu	32:44	And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears
deu	32:45	And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:
deu	32:46	And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which
deu	32:47	For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and
deu	32:48	And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying, 32:49
deu	32:50	And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto
deu	32:52	Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go
deu	33:1	And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed
deu	33:2	And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto
deu	33:3	Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and
deu	33:4	Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the
deu	33:5	And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the
deu	33:6	Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.
deu	33:7	And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the
deu	33:8	And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy
deu	33:10	They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they
deu	33:11	Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands;
deu	33:12	And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in
deu	33:13	And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for the
deu	33:17	His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns
deu	33:18	And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and,
deu	33:19	They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall
deu	33:20	And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he
deu	33:21	And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in a
deu	33:22	And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion’s whelp: he shall leap from
deu	33:23	And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and
deu	33:24	And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let
deu	33:25	Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy
deu	33:26	There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the
deu	33:27	The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the
deu	33:28	Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob
deu	33:29	Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people saved
deu	34:1	And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of
deu	34:4	And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto
deu	34:5	So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab,
deu	34:6	And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against
deu	34:7	And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his
deu	34:8	And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab
deu	34:9	And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for
deu	34:10	And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses,
jos	1:1	Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to
jos	1:3	Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have
jos	1:4	From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river,
jos	1:5	There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days
jos	1:6	Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou
jos	1:7	Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe
jos	1:8	This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou
jos	1:9	Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not
jos	1:10	Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, 1:11
jos	1:12	And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe
jos	1:14	Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in
jos	1:16	And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we
jos	1:17	According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we
jos	1:18	Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will
jos	2:1	And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy
jos	2:2	And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came
jos	2:3	And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the
jos	2:4	And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There
jos	2:6	But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them
jos	2:7	And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords:
jos	2:8	And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the
jos	2:10	For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea
jos	2:11	And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt,
jos	2:12	Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I
jos	2:14	And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not
jos	2:15	Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her
jos	2:16	And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the
jos	2:17	And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine
jos	2:18	Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of
jos	2:19	And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy
jos	2:20	And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of
jos	2:21	And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent
jos	2:22	And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three
jos	2:23	So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and
jos	3:1	And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from
jos	3:2	And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went
jos	3:4	Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand
jos	3:5	And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to
jos	3:6	And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the
jos	3:7	And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify
jos	3:8	And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the
jos	3:9	And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear
jos	3:10	And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is
jos	3:11	Behold, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth
jos	3:12	Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel,
jos	3:13	And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of
jos	3:14	And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to
jos	3:17	And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD
jos	4:1	And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over
jos	4:4	Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the
jos	4:8	And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up
jos	4:9	And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the
jos	4:10	For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan,
jos	4:11	And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over,
jos	4:12	And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the
jos	4:14	On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel;
jos	4:15	And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying, 4:16 Command the priests
jos	4:17	Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of
jos	4:18	And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the
jos	4:19	And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the
jos	4:20	And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did
jos	4:21	And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your
jos	4:23	For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before
jos	5:1	And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which
jos	5:2	At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives,
jos	5:3	And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of
jos	5:4	And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people
jos	5:5	Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the
jos	5:6	For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness,
jos	5:7	And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua
jos	5:8	And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the
jos	5:9	And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the
jos	5:10	And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the
jos	5:11	And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after
jos	5:12	And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the
jos	5:13	And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted
jos	6:1	Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of
jos	6:2	And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand
jos	6:3	And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round
jos	6:4	And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of
jos	6:5	And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with
jos	6:6	And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them,
jos	6:7	And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and
jos	6:8	And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that
jos	6:9	And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the
jos	6:10	And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout,
jos	6:11	So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once:
jos	6:12	And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the
jos	6:13	And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams’ horns before
jos	6:14	And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned
jos	6:15	And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early
jos	6:16	And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew
jos	6:17	And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are
jos	6:18	And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest
jos	6:19	But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are
jos	6:20	So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets:
jos	6:21	And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and
jos	6:22	But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the
jos	6:23	And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab,
jos	6:24	And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only
jos	6:25	And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father’s
jos	6:26	And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man
jos	6:27	So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout
jos	7:1	But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed
jos	7:2	And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven,
jos	7:3	And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the
jos	7:4	So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men:
jos	7:5	And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they
jos	7:6	And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face
jos	7:7	And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, wherefore hast thou at all
jos	7:12	Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their
jos	7:13	Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to
jos	7:14	In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your
jos	7:15	And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing
jos	7:16	So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by
jos	7:18	And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of
jos	7:19	And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to
jos	7:20	And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against
jos	7:22	So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and,
jos	7:23	And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them
jos	7:24	And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah,
jos	7:25	And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall
jos	7:26	And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So
jos	8:1	And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed:
jos	8:3	So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai:
jos	8:4	And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait
jos	8:7	Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city:
jos	8:8	And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set
jos	8:9	Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush,
jos	8:10	And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people,
jos	8:11	And all the people, even the people of war that were with him,
jos	8:12	And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in
jos	8:13	And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on
jos	8:14	And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted
jos	8:15	And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before
jos	8:16	And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue
jos	8:17	And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out
jos	8:18	And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in
jos	8:19	And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as
jos	8:20	And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold,
jos	8:21	And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the
jos	8:22	And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were
jos	8:23	And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
jos	8:24	And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all
jos	8:25	And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and
jos	8:26	For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the
jos	8:27	Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey
jos	8:28	And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a
jos	8:29	And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as
jos	8:30	Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount
jos	8:32	And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses,
jos	8:33	And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges,
jos	8:34	And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and
jos	8:35	There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua
jos	9:1	And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side
jos	9:2	That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and
jos	9:3	And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto
jos	9:6	And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto
jos	9:7	And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell
jos	9:10	And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were
jos	9:11	Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake
jos	9:12	This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on
jos	9:14	And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the
jos	9:15	And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to
jos	9:16	And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made
jos	9:17	And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities
jos	9:18	And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of
jos	9:19	But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn
jos	9:20	This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath
jos	9:21	And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be
jos	9:22	And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying,
jos	9:24	And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told
jos	9:25	And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and
jos	9:26	And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of
jos	9:27	And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water
jos	10:1	Now it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had heard
jos	10:3	Wherefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem, sent unto Hoham king of
jos	10:5	Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem,
jos	10:6	And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal,
jos	10:7	So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war
jos	10:8	And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have
jos	10:9	Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal
jos	10:10	And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with
jos	10:11	And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were
jos	10:12	Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered
jos	10:13	And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people
jos	10:14	And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the
jos	10:15	And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to
jos	10:16	But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at
jos	10:17	And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in
jos	10:18	And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave,
jos	10:20	And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had
jos	10:21	And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in
jos	10:22	Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out
jos	10:23	And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out
jos	10:24	And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto
jos	10:25	And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong
jos	10:26	And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them
jos	10:27	And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun,
jos	10:28	And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of
jos	10:29	Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto
jos	10:31	And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto
jos	10:33	Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua
jos	10:34	And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with
jos	10:36	And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto
jos	10:38	And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and
jos	10:40	So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south,
jos	10:41	And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and all
jos	10:42	And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time,
jos	10:43	And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to
jos	11:1	And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those
jos	11:4	And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much
jos	11:5	And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched
jos	11:6	And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for
jos	11:7	So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them
jos	11:8	And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote
jos	11:9	And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their
jos	11:10	And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote
jos	11:11	And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of
jos	11:12	And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them,
jos	11:13	But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel
jos	11:14	And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children
jos	11:15	As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command
jos	11:16	So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south
jos	11:18	Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
jos	11:19	There was not a city that made peace with the children of
jos	11:20	For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should
jos	11:21	And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the
jos	11:22	There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children
jos	11:23	So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD
jos	12:1	Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of Israel
jos	12:3	And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and unto
jos	12:6	Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel
jos	12:7	And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the
jos	12:10	The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one; 12:11 The
jos	13:1	Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said unto
jos	13:2	This is the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the
jos	13:6	All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto
jos	13:7	Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine
jos	13:13	Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites,
jos	13:14	Only unto the tribes of Levi he gave none inheritance; the
jos	13:15	And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben
jos	13:16	And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the river
jos	13:22	Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of
jos	13:23	And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the
jos	13:24	And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even unto the
jos	13:25	And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and
jos	13:28	This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their
jos	13:29	And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh: and
jos	13:30	And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom
jos	13:32	These are the countries which Moses did distribute for
jos	13:33	But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the
jos	14:1	And these are the countries which the children of Israel
jos	14:2	By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand
jos	14:3	For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half
jos	14:4	For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim:
jos	14:5	As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and
jos	14:6	Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb
jos	14:7	Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me
jos	14:8	Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of
jos	14:9	And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy
jos	14:10	And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these
jos	14:11	As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses
jos	14:12	Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in
jos	14:13	And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh
jos	14:14	Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of
jos	14:15	And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was a
jos	15:1	This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by
jos	15:2	And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from
jos	15:5	And the east border was the salt sea, even unto the end of
jos	15:9	And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the
jos	15:10	And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir,
jos	15:11	And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and
jos	15:12	And the west border was to the great sea, and the coast thereof.
jos	15:13	And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the
jos	15:14	And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and
jos	15:15	And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name
jos	15:16	And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to
jos	15:17	And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and
jos	15:18	And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him to
jos	15:20	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah
jos	15:21	And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah
jos	15:22	And Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah, 15:23 And Kedesh, and Hazor,
jos	15:28	And Hazarshual, and Beersheba, and Bizjothjah, 15:29 Baalah, and
jos	15:34	And Zanoah, and Engannim, Tappuah, and Enam, 15:35 Jarmuth, and
jos	15:57	Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages: 15:58
jos	15:63	As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children
jos	16:1	And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by
jos	16:3	And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the coast
jos	16:4	So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their
jos	16:5	And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their
jos	16:8	The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah;
jos	16:9	And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among
jos	16:10	And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but
jos	17:1	There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the
jos	17:2	There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by
jos	17:3	But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of
jos	17:4	And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua
jos	17:5	And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of
jos	17:7	And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that
jos	17:8	Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border
jos	17:11	And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her
jos	17:12	Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants
jos	17:13	Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen
jos	17:14	And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast
jos	17:16	And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us:
jos	17:17	And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and
jos	18:1	And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled
jos	18:2	And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes,
jos	18:3	And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye
jos	18:5	And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in
jos	18:6	Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and bring
jos	18:7	But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the
jos	18:8	And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that
jos	18:9	And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by
jos	18:10	And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and
jos	18:11	And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up
jos	18:12	And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the
jos	18:13	And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side of
jos	18:14	And the border was drawn thence, and compassed the corner of the
jos	18:15	And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjathjearim, and the
jos	18:17	And was drawn from the north, and went forth to Enshemesh, and
jos	18:20	And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This was the
jos	18:21	Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin

jos	19:11	And their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and
jos	19:15	And Kattath, and Nahallal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and
jos	19:16	This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to
jos	19:17	And the fourth lot came out to Issachar, for the children of
jos	19:18	And their border was toward Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem,
jos	19:19	And Haphraim, and Shihon, and Anaharath, 19:20 And Rabbith, and
jos	19:23	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar
jos	19:24	And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of
jos	19:25	And their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph,
jos	19:26	And Alammelech, and Amad, and Misheal; and reacheth to Carmel
jos	19:31	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher
jos	19:32	The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali, even for the
jos	19:33	And their coast was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, and
jos	19:35	And the fenced cities are Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and
jos	19:39	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali
jos	19:40	And the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of
jos	19:41	And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and
jos	19:47	And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for
jos	19:48	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan
jos	19:49	When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance
jos	19:51	These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua
jos	20:1	The LORD also spake unto Joshua, saying, 20:2 Speak to the
jos	20:4	And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand
jos	20:5	And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not
jos	20:6	And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the
jos	20:7	And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and
jos	20:8	And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they assigned
jos	20:9	These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel,
jos	21:1	Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites unto
jos	21:3	And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their

jos	21:5	And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the

jos	21:10	Which the children of Aaron, being of the families of the
jos	21:11	And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak, which
jos	21:12	But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they
jos	21:13	Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with
jos	21:16	And Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs, and
jos	21:17	And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs, Geba
jos	21:19	All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were
jos	21:20	And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites which
jos	21:21	For they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim, to
jos	21:23	And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with her suburbs, Gibbethon
jos	21:25	And out of the half tribe of Manasseh, Tanach with her suburbs,

jos	21:39	Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer with her suburbs; four cities in
jos	21:40	So all the cities for the children of Merari by their families,
jos	21:41	All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the
jos	21:42	These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them:
jos	21:43	And the LORD gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to
jos	21:44	And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all that
jos	21:45	There failed not ought of any good thing which the LORD had
jos	22:1	Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half
jos	22:4	And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as
jos	22:5	But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which
jos	22:6	So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto
jos	22:7	Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given
jos	22:9	And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half
jos	22:10	And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the
jos	22:11	And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of
jos	22:12	And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole
jos	22:13	And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and
jos	22:15	And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children
jos	22:19	Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then
jos	22:20	Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed
jos	22:21	Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half
jos	22:26	Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not
jos	22:28	Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to
jos	22:29	God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this
jos	22:30	And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the
jos	22:31	And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the
jos	22:32	And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes,
jos	22:33	And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children
jos	22:34	And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the
jos	23:1	And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given
jos	23:2	And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for
jos	23:4	Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain,
jos	23:5	And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and
jos	23:6	Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is
jos	23:9	For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and
jos	23:10	One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he
jos	23:11	Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the LORD
jos	23:12	Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant
jos	23:14	And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and
jos	23:15	Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are
jos	23:16	When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God,
jos	24:1	And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and
jos	24:2	And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of
jos	24:3	And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood,
jos	24:4	And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount
jos	24:5	I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to
jos	24:6	And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the
jos	24:7	And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you
jos	24:8	And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on
jos	24:9	Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred
jos	24:11	And you went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of
jos	24:12	And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from
jos	24:13	And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and
jos	24:14	Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in
jos	24:15	And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this
jos	24:16	And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should
jos	24:19	And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for
jos	24:20	If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will
jos	24:21	And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the
jos	24:22	And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against
jos	24:23	Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are
jos	24:24	And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve,
jos	24:25	So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them
jos	24:26	And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and
jos	24:27	And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be
jos	24:28	So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.
jos	24:29	And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of
jos	24:30	And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in
jos	24:31	And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the
jos	24:32	And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up
jos	24:33	And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill
jdg	1:1	Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children
jdg	1:3	And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my
jdg	1:4	And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the
jdg	1:5	And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him,
jdg	1:6	But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him,
jdg	1:7	And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs
jdg	1:8	Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had
jdg	1:9	And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the
jdg	1:10	And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now
jdg	1:11	And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the
jdg	1:13	And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it:
jdg	1:14	And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to
jdg	1:16	And the children of the Kenite, Moses’ father in law, went up out
jdg	1:17	And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the
jdg	1:18	Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the
jdg	1:19	And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of
jdg	1:20	And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled
jdg	1:21	And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that
jdg	1:22	And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and
jdg	1:23	And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of
jdg	1:25	And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote
jdg	1:26	And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city,
jdg	1:27	Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and
jdg	1:28	And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the
jdg	1:29	Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer;
jdg	1:30	Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the
jdg	1:31	Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the
jdg	1:33	Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh,
jdg	1:34	And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain:
jdg	1:36	And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim,
jdg	2:1	And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said,
jdg	2:2	And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye
jdg	2:4	And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these words
jdg	2:5	And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed
jdg	2:6	And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went
jdg	2:7	And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the
jdg	2:8	And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an
jdg	2:9	And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in
jdg	2:10	And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers:
jdg	2:11	And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and
jdg	2:13	And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.
jdg	2:14	And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he
jdg	2:15	Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against
jdg	2:16	Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out
jdg	2:17	And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a
jdg	2:18	And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with
jdg	2:19	And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned,
jdg	2:20	And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said,
jdg	2:23	Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out
jdg	3:1	Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by
jdg	3:2	Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to
jdg	3:4	And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would
jdg	3:5	And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites,
jdg	3:7	And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and
jdg	3:8	Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he
jdg	3:9	And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD
jdg	3:10	And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel,
jdg	3:11	And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz
jdg	3:12	And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
jdg	3:13	And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and
jdg	3:14	So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen
jdg	3:15	But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD
jdg	3:16	But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit
jdg	3:17	And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was
jdg	3:18	And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away
jdg	3:19	But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by
jdg	3:20	And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour,
jdg	3:21	And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his
jdg	3:23	Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the
jdg	3:24	When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that,
jdg	3:25	And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened
jdg	3:26	And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the
jdg	3:27	And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in
jdg	3:28	And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath
jdg	3:29	And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all
jdg	3:30	So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the
jdg	3:31	And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the
jdg	4:1	And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the
jdg	4:2	And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that
jdg	4:3	And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine
jdg	4:4	And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel
jdg	4:5	And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and
jdg	4:6	And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of
jdg	4:8	And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go:
jdg	4:9	And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the
jdg	4:10	And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up
jdg	4:11	Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the
jdg	4:12	And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up
jdg	4:13	And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred
jdg	4:14	And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the
jdg	4:15	And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all
jdg	4:16	But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto
jdg	4:17	Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife
jdg	4:18	And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my
jdg	4:19	And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to
jdg	4:20	Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it
jdg	4:21	Then Jael Heber’s wife took a nail of the tent, and took an
jdg	4:22	And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him,
jdg	4:23	So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the
jdg	4:24	And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed
jdg	5:1	Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day,
jdg	5:3	Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing
jdg	5:4	LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of
jdg	5:5	The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from
jdg	5:6	In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the
jdg	5:7	The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel,
jdg	5:8	They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield
jdg	5:10	Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and
jdg	5:11	They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places
jdg	5:12	Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak,
jdg	5:13	Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles
jdg	5:14	Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after
jdg	5:15	And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar, and
jdg	5:16	Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of
jdg	5:17	Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships?
jdg	5:18	Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives
jdg	5:19	The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in
jdg	5:20	They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought
jdg	5:21	The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the
jdg	5:22	Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings,
jdg	5:23	Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly the
jdg	5:24	Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be,
jdg	5:25	He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter
jdg	5:26	She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen’s
jdg	5:27	At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed,
jdg	5:28	The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through
jdg	6:1	And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and
jdg	6:2	And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of
jdg	6:3	And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up,
jdg	6:5	For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came
jdg	6:6	And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and
jdg	6:7	And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the
jdg	6:11	And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which
jdg	6:12	And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him,
jdg	6:13	And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why
jdg	6:14	And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and
jdg	6:16	And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou
jdg	6:17	And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight,
jdg	6:18	Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring
jdg	6:19	And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of
jdg	6:20	And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the
jdg	6:21	Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that
jdg	6:22	And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD,
jdg	6:23	And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou
jdg	6:24	Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it
jdg	6:25	And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him,
jdg	6:27	Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had
jdg	6:28	And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold,
jdg	6:29	And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when
jdg	6:30	Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that
jdg	6:31	And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for
jdg	6:32	Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal
jdg	6:33	Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of
jdg	6:34	But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a
jdg	6:35	And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was
jdg	6:36	And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand,
jdg	6:38	And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the
jdg	6:39	And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me,
jdg	6:40	And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only,
jdg	7:1	Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with
jdg	7:2	And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are
jdg	7:3	Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying,
jdg	7:4	And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring
jdg	7:5	So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said
jdg	7:6	And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their
jdg	7:7	And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that
jdg	7:8	So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and
jdg	7:9	And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him,
jdg	7:10	But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down
jdg	7:12	And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the
jdg	7:13	And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a
jdg	7:14	And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the
jdg	7:15	And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and
jdg	7:16	And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he
jdg	7:17	And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold,
jdg	7:18	When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow
jdg	7:19	So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the
jdg	7:20	And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the
jdg	7:21	And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and
jdg	7:22	And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every
jdg	7:23	And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of
jdg	7:24	And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying,
jdg	7:25	And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and
jdg	8:1	And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us
jdg	8:2	And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you?
jdg	8:4	And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three
jdg	8:5	And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of
jdg	8:6	And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and
jdg	8:7	And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and
jdg	8:8	And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise: and
jdg	8:9	And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come
jdg	8:10	Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them,
jdg	8:11	And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the
jdg	8:12	And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took
jdg	8:13	And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun
jdg	8:15	And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and
jdg	8:17	And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the
jdg	8:18	Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were
jdg	8:19	And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother:
jdg	8:20	And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the
jdg	8:21	Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as
jdg	8:22	Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both
jdg	8:23	And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither
jdg	8:24	And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that
jdg	8:26	And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a
jdg	8:27	And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in
jdg	8:28	Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that
jdg	8:29	And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.
jdg	8:30	And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for
jdg	8:31	And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son,
jdg	8:32	And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was
jdg	8:33	And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the
jdg	8:34	And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who
jdg	9:1	And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his
jdg	9:3	And his mother’s brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men
jdg	9:4	And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the
jdg	9:5	And he went unto his father’s house at Ophrah, and slew his
jdg	9:6	And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of
jdg	9:7	And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of
jdg	9:8	The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and
jdg	9:9	But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness,
jdg	9:11	But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness,
jdg	9:13	And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which
jdg	9:15	And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me
jdg	9:16	Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye
jdg	9:21	And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there,
jdg	9:22	When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel, 9:23 Then God
jdg	9:25	And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of
jdg	9:26	And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to
jdg	9:27	And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards,
jdg	9:28	And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is
jdg	9:30	And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the
jdg	9:31	And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold,
jdg	9:32	Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that is with thee,
jdg	9:34	And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by
jdg	9:35	And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of
jdg	9:36	And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there
jdg	9:37	And Gaal spake again, and said, See there come people down by the
jdg	9:38	Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith thou
jdg	9:39	And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with
jdg	9:40	And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were
jdg	9:41	And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his
jdg	9:42	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into
jdg	9:43	And he took the people, and divided them into three companies,
jdg	9:44	And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward,
jdg	9:45	And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took
jdg	9:46	And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they
jdg	9:47	And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of
jdg	9:48	And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people
jdg	9:49	And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and
jdg	9:50	Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and
jdg	9:51	But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled
jdg	9:52	And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and
jdg	9:53	And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech’s
jdg	9:54	Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and
jdg	9:55	And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they
jdg	9:56	Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto
jdg	10:1	And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of
jdg	10:2	And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was
jdg	10:3	And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty
jdg	10:4	And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they
jdg	10:5	And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.
jdg	10:6	And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
jdg	10:7	And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold
jdg	10:8	And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel:
jdg	10:9	Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also
jdg	10:10	And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We have
jdg	10:11	And the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Did not I deliver
jdg	10:13	Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will
jdg	10:14	Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver
jdg	10:15	And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned:
jdg	10:16	And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served
jdg	10:17	Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped
jdg	10:18	And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What
jdg	11:1	Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he was
jdg	11:2	And Gilead’s wife bare him sons; and his wife’s sons grew up, and
jdg	11:3	Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of
jdg	11:4	And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of
jdg	11:5	And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against
jdg	11:7	And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me,
jdg	11:9	And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home
jdg	11:11	Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people
jdg	11:12	And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of
jdg	11:14	And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children
jdg	11:16	But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the
jdg	11:18	Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the
jdg	11:19	And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the
jdg	11:20	But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but
jdg	11:21	And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people
jdg	11:22	And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon
jdg	11:23	So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites
jdg	11:25	And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor,
jdg	11:28	Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the
jdg	11:29	Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed
jdg	11:30	And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt
jdg	11:32	So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight
jdg	11:33	And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith,
jdg	11:34	And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his
jdg	11:35	And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes,
jdg	11:36	And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth
jdg	11:37	And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let
jdg	11:38	And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she
jdg	11:39	And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned
jdg	12:1	And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went
jdg	12:2	And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife
jdg	12:3	And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my
jdg	12:5	And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the
jdg	12:7	And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the
jdg	12:8	And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.
jdg	12:9	And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent
jdg	12:10	Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.
jdg	12:11	And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged
jdg	12:12	And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the
jdg	12:13	And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged
jdg	12:14	And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on
jdg	12:15	And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried
jdg	13:1	And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
jdg	13:2	And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the
jdg	13:3	And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto
jdg	13:4	Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong
jdg	13:6	Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God
jdg	13:8	Then Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man
jdg	13:9	And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God
jdg	13:10	And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and
jdg	13:11	And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man,
jdg	13:12	And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we
jdg	13:14	She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither
jdg	13:15	And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us
jdg	13:16	And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain
jdg	13:17	And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name,
jdg	13:20	For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from
jdg	13:21	But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to
jdg	13:22	And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we
jdg	13:23	But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us,
jdg	13:24	And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the
jdg	13:25	And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the
jdg	14:1	And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of
jdg	14:2	And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I
jdg	14:3	Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a
jdg	14:4	But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD,
jdg	14:5	Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath,
jdg	14:6	And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent
jdg	14:7	And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased
jdg	14:8	And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to
jdg	14:9	And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to
jdg	14:10	So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a
jdg	14:11	And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty
jdg	14:12	And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto
jdg	14:14	And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out
jdg	14:15	And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto
jdg	14:18	And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before
jdg	14:19	And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to
jdg	14:20	But Samson’s wife was given to his companion, whom he had used
jdg	15:1	But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat
jdg	15:2	And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly
jdg	15:3	And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless
jdg	15:4	And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took
jdg	15:5	And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the
jdg	15:6	Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered,
jdg	15:7	And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I
jdg	15:8	And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he
jdg	15:9	Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread
jdg	15:10	And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And
jdg	15:11	Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock
jdg	15:12	And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we
jdg	15:13	And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast,
jdg	15:14	And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him:
jdg	15:15	And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand,
jdg	15:16	And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps,
jdg	15:17	And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that
jdg	15:18	And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said, Thou
jdg	15:20	And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty
jdg	16:1	Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in
jdg	16:2	And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And
jdg	16:3	And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the
jdg	16:4	And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the
jdg	16:5	And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto
jdg	16:6	And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy
jdg	16:7	And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs
jdg	16:8	Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green
jdg	16:9	Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the
jdg	16:10	And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and
jdg	16:11	And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that
jdg	16:12	Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and
jdg	16:13	And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and
jdg	16:14	And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The
jdg	16:15	And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when
jdg	16:16	And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words,
jdg	16:18	And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she
jdg	16:19	And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man,
jdg	16:20	And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke
jdg	16:21	But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought
jdg	16:22	Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was
jdg	16:23	Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to
jdg	16:24	And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they
jdg	16:25	And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they
jdg	16:26	And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer
jdg	16:27	Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of
jdg	16:28	And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord God, remember
jdg	16:29	And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the
jdg	16:30	And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed
jdg	16:31	Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and
jdg	17:1	And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
jdg	17:2	And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver
jdg	17:3	And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to
jdg	17:4	Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took
jdg	17:5	And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and
jdg	17:6	In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that
jdg	17:7	And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of
jdg	17:8	And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to
jdg	17:9	And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto
jdg	17:10	And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father
jdg	17:11	And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young
jdg	17:12	And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his
jdg	17:13	Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good,
jdg	18:1	In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the
jdg	18:2	And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their
jdg	18:3	When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the
jdg	18:5	And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that
jdg	18:6	And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD is
jdg	18:7	Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people
jdg	18:8	And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their
jdg	18:10	When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large
jdg	18:11	And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of
jdg	18:12	And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah:
jdg	18:13	And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the
jdg	18:14	Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of
jdg	18:15	And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young
jdg	18:16	And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war,
jdg	18:17	And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came
jdg	18:18	And these went into Micah’s house, and fetched the carved image,
jdg	18:21	So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the
jdg	18:22	And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men
jdg	18:23	And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their
jdg	18:26	And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that
jdg	18:27	And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest
jdg	18:28	And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and
jdg	18:29	And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan
jdg	18:30	And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan,
jdg	18:31	And they set them up Micah’s graven image, which he made, all
jdg	19:1	And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in
jdg	19:2	And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away
jdg	19:3	And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto
jdg	19:4	And his father in law, the damsel’s father, retained him; and he
jdg	19:5	And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in
jdg	19:6	And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together:
jdg	19:7	And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him:
jdg	19:8	And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and
jdg	19:9	And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and
jdg	19:10	But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and
jdg	19:11	And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the
jdg	19:12	And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into
jdg	19:13	And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one
jdg	19:14	And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down
jdg	19:15	And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah:
jdg	19:16	And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the
jdg	19:17	And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in
jdg	19:19	Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there
jdg	19:20	And the old man said, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all thy
jdg	19:21	So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the
jdg	19:22	Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of
jdg	19:23	And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and
jdg	19:24	Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I
jdg	19:25	But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his
jdg	19:26	Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at
jdg	19:27	And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the
jdg	19:28	And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none
jdg	19:29	And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid
jdg	19:30	And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed
jdg	20:1	Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation
jdg	20:2	And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of
jdg	20:3	(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel
jdg	20:5	And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round
jdg	20:6	And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her
jdg	20:7	Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice and
jdg	20:8	And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of
jdg	20:9	But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we
jdg	20:11	So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit
jdg	20:12	And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of
jdg	20:13	Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which
jdg	20:14	But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of
jdg	20:15	And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of
jdg	20:16	Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men
jdg	20:17	And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four
jdg	20:18	And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of
jdg	20:19	And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped
jdg	20:20	And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and
jdg	20:21	And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and
jdg	20:22	And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set
jdg	20:23	(And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD
jdg	20:25	And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second
jdg	20:26	Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up,
jdg	20:27	And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark of

jdg	20:32	And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before
jdg	20:33	And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put
jdg	20:34	And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all
jdg	20:35	And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of
jdg	20:36	So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the
jdg	20:37	And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the
jdg	20:38	Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and
jdg	20:39	And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began
jdg	20:40	But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a

jdg	20:42	Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto
jdg	20:43	Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them,
jdg	20:44	And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were
jdg	20:45	And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of
jdg	20:46	So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five
jdg	20:47	But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the

jdg	21:5	And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the
jdg	21:6	And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their
jdg	21:7	How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have
jdg	21:9	For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the
jdg	21:10	And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the

jdg	21:12	And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four
jdg	21:13	And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of

jdg	21:15	And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the LORD
jdg	21:16	Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for
jdg	21:18	Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the
jdg	21:19	Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh
jdg	21:20	Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go
jdg	21:22	And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto
jdg	21:23	And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives,
jdg	21:24	And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every
jdg	21:25	In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that
rut	1:1	Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there
rut	1:2	And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife
rut	1:3	And Elimelech Naomi’s husband died; and she was left, and her two
rut	1:4	And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one
rut	1:5	And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was
rut	1:6	Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return
rut	1:7	Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her
rut	1:8	And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to
rut	1:9	The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house
rut	1:10	And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy
rut	1:11	And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me?
rut	1:14	And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed
rut	1:15	And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her
rut	1:16	And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from
rut	1:18	When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then
rut	1:19	So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to
rut	1:21	I went out full and the LORD hath brought me home again empty:
rut	2:1	And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth,
rut	2:2	And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the
rut	2:3	And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the
rut	2:4	And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers,
rut	2:5	Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers,
rut	2:8	Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to
rut	2:10	Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and
rut	2:12	The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of
rut	2:13	Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that
rut	2:14	And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of
rut	2:15	And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men,
rut	2:16	And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and
rut	2:17	So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had
rut	2:18	And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law
rut	2:19	And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to
rut	2:20	And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the
rut	2:21	And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt
rut	2:22	And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my
rut	2:23	So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of
rut	3:1	Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I
rut	3:3	Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon
rut	3:4	And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the
rut	3:5	And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.
rut	3:6	And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that
rut	3:7	And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he
rut	3:8	And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and
rut	3:9	And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine
rut	3:10	And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for thou
rut	3:11	And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou
rut	3:12	And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a
rut	3:13	Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will
rut	3:14	And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before
rut	3:15	Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold
rut	3:16	And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou,
rut	3:17	And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he
rut	3:18	Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the
rut	4:1	Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and,
rut	4:2	And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye
rut	4:3	And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the
rut	4:5	Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of
rut	4:6	And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar
rut	4:7	Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning
rut	4:8	Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew
rut	4:9	And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are
rut	4:10	Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased
rut	4:11	And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said,
rut	4:12	And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare
rut	4:13	So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto
rut	4:14	And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath
rut	4:15	And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher
rut	4:16	And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became
rut	4:17	And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a
rut	4:18	Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,
rut	4:19	And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab, 4:20 And Amminadab
1sa	1:1	Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim,
1sa	1:3	And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to
1sa	1:4	And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah
1sa	1:6	And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret,
1sa	1:7	And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of
1sa	1:8	Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou?
1sa	1:10	And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and
1sa	1:11	And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt
1sa	1:12	And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD,
1sa	1:13	Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her
1sa	1:14	And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away
1sa	1:15	And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a
1sa	1:16	Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the
1sa	1:17	Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel
1sa	1:18	And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the
1sa	1:19	And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the
1sa	1:20	Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after
1sa	1:21	And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the
1sa	1:22	But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not
1sa	1:23	And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good;
1sa	1:24	And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three
1sa	1:25	And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.
1sa	1:26	And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the
1sa	1:27	For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition
1sa	2:1	And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine
1sa	2:2	There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee:
1sa	2:3	Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of
1sa	2:4	The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are
1sa	2:5	They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they
1sa	2:6	The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave,
1sa	2:7	The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and
1sa	2:8	He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar
1sa	2:9	He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be
1sa	2:10	The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of
1sa	2:11	And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did
1sa	2:12	Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.
1sa	2:13	And the priest’s custom with the people was, that, when any man
1sa	2:15	Also before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and
1sa	2:16	And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat
1sa	2:17	Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the
1sa	2:18	But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with
1sa	2:19	Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him
1sa	2:20	And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give
1sa	2:21	And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare
1sa	2:22	Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all
1sa	2:23	And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your
1sa	2:24	Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the
1sa	2:25	If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if
1sa	2:26	And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the
1sa	2:27	And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus
1sa	2:31	Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm
1sa	2:32	And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth
1sa	2:33	And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar,
1sa	2:34	And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two
1sa	2:35	And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according
1sa	2:36	And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine
1sa	3:1	And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the
1sa	3:2	And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his
1sa	3:5	And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me.
1sa	3:6	And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went
1sa	3:7	Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the
1sa	3:8	And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and
1sa	3:9	Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if
1sa	3:10	And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times,
1sa	3:11	And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel,
1sa	3:12	In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have
1sa	3:13	For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the
1sa	3:14	And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the
1sa	3:15	And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the
1sa	3:16	Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he
1sa	3:17	And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee?
1sa	3:18	And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he
1sa	3:19	And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of
1sa	3:20	And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was
1sa	3:21	And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed
1sa	4:1	And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out
1sa	4:2	And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and
1sa	4:3	And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel
1sa	4:4	So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence
1sa	4:5	And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp,
1sa	4:6	And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said,
1sa	4:7	And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into
1sa	4:8	Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty
1sa	4:9	Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye
1sa	4:10	And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled
1sa	4:11	And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and
1sa	4:12	And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to
1sa	4:13	And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside
1sa	4:14	And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth
1sa	4:15	Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim,
1sa	4:16	And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and
1sa	4:18	And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that
1sa	4:19	And his daughter in law, Phinehas’ wife, was with child, near to
1sa	4:20	And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said
1sa	4:21	And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed
1sa	4:22	And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of
1sa	5:1	And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from
1sa	5:2	When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the
1sa	5:3	And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon
1sa	5:4	And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was
1sa	5:5	Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into
1sa	5:6	But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he
1sa	5:7	And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark
1sa	5:8	They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines
1sa	5:9	And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of
1sa	5:10	Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass,
1sa	5:11	So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the
1sa	5:12	And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the
1sa	6:1	And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines
1sa	6:2	And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners,
1sa	6:3	And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send
1sa	6:4	Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall
1sa	6:5	Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your
1sa	6:6	Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and
1sa	6:9	And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to
1sa	6:10	And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the
1sa	6:12	And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, and
1sa	6:13	And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the
1sa	6:14	And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and
1sa	6:15	And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer
1sa	6:16	And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they
1sa	6:17	And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned
1sa	6:19	And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into
1sa	6:20	And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this
1sa	7:1	And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the
1sa	7:2	And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that
1sa	7:3	And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do
1sa	7:4	Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and
1sa	7:5	And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for
1sa	7:6	And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured
1sa	7:7	And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were
1sa	7:8	And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto
1sa	7:9	And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt
1sa	7:10	And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines
1sa	7:11	And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the
1sa	7:12	Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and
1sa	7:13	So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the
1sa	7:14	And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were
1sa	7:15	And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
1sa	7:16	And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal,
1sa	7:17	And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there
1sa	8:1	And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons
1sa	8:2	Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his
1sa	8:3	And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre,
1sa	8:4	Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and
1sa	8:6	But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to
1sa	8:7	And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the
1sa	8:8	According to all the works which they have done since the day that
1sa	8:9	Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest
1sa	8:10	And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that
1sa	8:11	And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign
1sa	8:12	And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains
1sa	8:13	And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be
1sa	8:14	And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your
1sa	8:15	And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards,
1sa	8:16	And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and
1sa	8:17	He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his
1sa	8:18	And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye
1sa	8:19	Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and
1sa	8:21	And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed
1sa	8:22	And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make
1sa	9:1	Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of
1sa	9:2	And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a
1sa	9:3	And the asses of Kish Saul’s father were lost. And Kish said to
1sa	9:4	And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land
1sa	9:5	And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his
1sa	9:6	And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of
1sa	9:7	Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall
1sa	9:9	(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he
1sa	9:11	And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young
1sa	9:12	And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before
1sa	9:14	And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the
1sa	9:15	Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came,
1sa	9:17	And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man
1sa	9:18	Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I
1sa	9:19	And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before
1sa	9:20	And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy
1sa	9:23	And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave
1sa	9:24	And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it,
1sa	9:25	And when they were come down from the high place into the city,
1sa	9:26	And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the
1sa	9:27	And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said
1sa	10:1	Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and
1sa	10:4	And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread;
1sa	10:5	After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the
1sa	10:7	And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do
1sa	10:8	And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will
1sa	10:9	And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from
1sa	10:10	And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of
1sa	10:11	And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that,
1sa	10:14	And Saul’s uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went
1sa	10:15	And Saul’s uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said
1sa	10:16	And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses
1sa	10:17	And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;
1sa	10:18	And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of
1sa	10:20	And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come
1sa	10:21	When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their
1sa	10:22	Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should
1sa	10:23	And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the
1sa	10:24	And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath
1sa	10:25	Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote
1sa	10:26	And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a
1sa	10:27	But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And
1sa	11:1	Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against
1sa	11:2	And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I
1sa	11:3	And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days’
1sa	11:4	Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings
1sa	11:5	And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul
1sa	11:6	And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings,
1sa	11:7	And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent
1sa	11:8	And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were
1sa	11:9	And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say
1sa	11:10	Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out
1sa	11:11	And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three
1sa	11:12	And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul
1sa	11:13	And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day:
1sa	11:14	Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal,
1sa	11:15	And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king
1sa	12:1	And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto
1sa	12:2	And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and
1sa	12:3	Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before
1sa	12:4	And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us,
1sa	12:5	And he said unto them, The LORD is witness against you, and his
1sa	12:6	And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced
1sa	12:7	Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the
1sa	12:8	When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the
1sa	12:9	And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the
1sa	12:10	And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because
1sa	12:11	And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and
1sa	12:12	And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon
1sa	12:13	Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye
1sa	12:14	If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and
1sa	12:16	Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD
1sa	12:17	Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the LORD, and
1sa	12:18	So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and
1sa	12:19	And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto
1sa	12:20	And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this
1sa	12:22	For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name’s
1sa	12:23	Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the
1sa	12:25	But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye
1sa	13:1	Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over
1sa	13:3	And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in
1sa	13:4	And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the
1sa	13:5	And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with
1sa	13:6	When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the
1sa	13:7	And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and
1sa	13:8	And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel
1sa	13:9	And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace
1sa	13:10	And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of
1sa	13:11	And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I
1sa	13:13	And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not
1sa	13:14	But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him
1sa	13:15	And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of
1sa	13:16	And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present
1sa	13:17	And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in
1sa	13:19	Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel:
1sa	13:20	But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen
1sa	13:21	Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and
1sa	13:22	So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither
1sa	13:23	And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of
1sa	14:1	Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul
1sa	14:2	And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a
1sa	14:4	And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over
1sa	14:5	The forefront of the one was situate northward over against
1sa	14:6	And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come,
1sa	14:7	And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine
1sa	14:8	Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and
1sa	14:9	If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we
1sa	14:10	But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for
1sa	14:11	And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the
1sa	14:12	And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his
1sa	14:13	And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and
1sa	14:14	And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer
1sa	14:15	And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all
1sa	14:16	And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and,
1sa	14:17	Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now,
1sa	14:18	And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the
1sa	14:19	And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the
1sa	14:20	And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled
1sa	14:21	Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that
1sa	14:22	Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount
1sa	14:23	So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over
1sa	14:24	And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had
1sa	14:25	And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey
1sa	14:26	And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey
1sa	14:27	But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with
1sa	14:28	Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly
1sa	14:29	Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I
1sa	14:30	How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of
1sa	14:32	And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen,
1sa	14:33	Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the
1sa	14:34	And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say
1sa	14:35	And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first
1sa	14:36	And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night,
1sa	14:37	And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the
1sa	14:38	And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people:
1sa	14:39	For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in
1sa	14:40	Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and
1sa	14:41	Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect
1sa	14:42	And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And
1sa	14:43	Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And
1sa	14:44	And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt
1sa	14:45	And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath
1sa	14:46	Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the
1sa	14:47	So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his
1sa	14:48	And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered
1sa	14:49	Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua:
1sa	14:51	And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was
1sa	14:52	And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of
1sa	15:1	Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be
1sa	15:2	Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to
1sa	15:3	Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have,
1sa	15:4	And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in
1sa	15:5	And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.
1sa	15:6	And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from
1sa	15:7	And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to
1sa	15:8	And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly
1sa	15:9	But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep,
1sa	15:10	Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying, 15:11 It
1sa	15:12	And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was
1sa	15:13	And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou
1sa	15:14	And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in
1sa	15:16	Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the
1sa	15:17	And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast
1sa	15:19	Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but
1sa	15:20	And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the
1sa	15:21	But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of
1sa	15:22	And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt
1sa	15:23	For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is
1sa	15:24	And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have
1sa	15:25	Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with
1sa	15:26	And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou
1sa	15:27	And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the
1sa	15:28	And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of
1sa	15:29	And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he
1sa	15:30	Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee,
1sa	15:31	So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.
1sa	15:32	Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the
1sa	15:33	And Samuel said, As the sword hath made women childless, so
1sa	15:34	Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to
1sa	15:35	And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death:
1sa	16:1	And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul,
1sa	16:2	And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me.
1sa	16:3	And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou
1sa	16:4	And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem.
1sa	16:6	And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on
1sa	16:7	But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on
1sa	16:8	Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And
1sa	16:9	Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the
1sa	16:10	Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And
1sa	16:11	And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he
1sa	16:12	And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of
1sa	16:13	Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst
1sa	16:14	But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil
1sa	16:15	And Saul’s servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit
1sa	16:16	Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to
1sa	16:17	And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can
1sa	16:18	Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen
1sa	16:19	Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me
1sa	16:20	And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine,
1sa	16:21	And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him
1sa	16:22	And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand
1sa	16:23	And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon
1sa	17:1	Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and
1sa	17:2	And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and
1sa	17:3	And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and
1sa	17:4	And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines,
1sa	17:5	And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed
1sa	17:6	And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass
1sa	17:7	And the staff of his spear was like a weaver’s beam; and his
1sa	17:8	And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto
1sa	17:9	If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be
1sa	17:10	And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day;
1sa	17:11	When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine,
1sa	17:12	Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah,
1sa	17:13	And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the
1sa	17:14	And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.
1sa	17:15	But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father’s sheep
1sa	17:16	And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented
1sa	17:17	And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an
1sa	17:19	Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the
1sa	17:20	And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with
1sa	17:21	For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army
1sa	17:22	And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the
1sa	17:23	And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion,
1sa	17:24	And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him,
1sa	17:25	And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come
1sa	17:26	And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall
1sa	17:28	And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men;
1sa	17:29	And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?
1sa	17:30	And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same
1sa	17:31	And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed
1sa	17:32	And David said to Saul, Let no man’s heart fail because of him;
1sa	17:33	And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this
1sa	17:34	And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father’s sheep,
1sa	17:35	And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of
1sa	17:36	Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this
1sa	17:37	David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw
1sa	17:38	And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of
1sa	17:39	And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to
1sa	17:40	And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth
1sa	17:41	And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man
1sa	17:42	And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he
1sa	17:43	And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest
1sa	17:44	And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give
1sa	17:45	Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a
1sa	17:46	This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will
1sa	17:47	And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with
1sa	17:48	And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and
1sa	17:49	And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and
1sa	17:50	So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a
1sa	17:51	Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his
1sa	17:52	And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and
1sa	17:53	And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the
1sa	17:54	And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to
1sa	17:55	And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said
1sa	17:56	And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.
1sa	17:57	And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine,
1sa	17:58	And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And
1sa	18:1	And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto
1sa	18:2	And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to
1sa	18:3	Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as
1sa	18:4	And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and
1sa	18:5	And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved
1sa	18:6	And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from
1sa	18:7	And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul
1sa	18:8	And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he
1sa	18:9	And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.
1sa	18:10	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God
1sa	18:11	And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even
1sa	18:12	And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and
1sa	18:13	Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain
1sa	18:14	And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD
1sa	18:15	Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he
1sa	18:16	But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and
1sa	18:17	And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will
1sa	18:18	And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my
1sa	18:19	But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul’s daughter
1sa	18:20	And Michal Saul’s daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and
1sa	18:21	And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to
1sa	18:22	And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David
1sa	18:23	And Saul’s servants spake those words in the ears of David. And
1sa	18:25	And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not
1sa	18:26	And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David
1sa	18:27	Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the
1sa	18:28	And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that
1sa	18:29	And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became
1sa	18:30	Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to
1sa	19:1	And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that
1sa	19:2	But Jonathan Saul’s son delighted much in David: and Jonathan
1sa	19:4	And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said
1sa	19:7	And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those
1sa	19:8	And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the
1sa	19:9	And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his
1sa	19:10	And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the
1sa	19:11	Saul also sent messengers unto David’s house, to watch him, and
1sa	19:12	So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and
1sa	19:13	And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a
1sa	19:14	And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is
1sa	19:15	And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring
1sa	19:16	And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image
1sa	19:17	And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and
1sa	19:19	And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in
1sa	19:20	And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the
1sa	19:21	And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they
1sa	19:22	Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in
1sa	19:23	And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God
1sa	19:24	And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before
1sa	20:3	And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth
1sa	20:4	Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I
1sa	20:5	And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon,
1sa	20:6	If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked
1sa	20:7	If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if
1sa	20:8	Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast
1sa	20:12	And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have
1sa	20:14	And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of
1sa	20:16	So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let
1sa	20:17	And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him:
1sa	20:18	Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou
1sa	20:19	And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down
1sa	20:20	And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I
1sa	20:21	And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows.
1sa	20:22	But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are
1sa	20:23	And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of,
1sa	20:24	So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was
1sa	20:25	And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a
1sa	20:26	Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought,
1sa	20:27	And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of
1sa	20:30	Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto
1sa	20:32	And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him,
1sa	20:34	So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no
1sa	20:35	And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into
1sa	20:36	And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I
1sa	20:37	And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which
1sa	20:39	But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the
1sa	20:40	And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him,
1sa	20:41	And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place
1sa	20:42	And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have
1sa	21:1	Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was
1sa	21:3	Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of
1sa	21:4	And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread
1sa	21:5	And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth
1sa	21:6	So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread
1sa	21:7	Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day,
1sa	21:8	And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine
1sa	21:9	And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom
1sa	21:10	And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to
1sa	21:11	And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the
1sa	21:12	And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid
1sa	21:13	And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself
1sa	21:14	Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad:
1sa	22:2	And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in
1sa	22:3	And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the
1sa	22:4	And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with
1sa	22:5	And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold;
1sa	22:6	When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were
1sa	22:10	And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and
1sa	22:11	Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of
1sa	22:12	And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered,
1sa	22:13	And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou
1sa	22:16	And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and
1sa	22:17	And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn,
1sa	22:18	And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests.
1sa	22:19	And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the
1sa	22:20	And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named
1sa	22:21	And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD’s
1sa	22:22	And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the
1sa	22:23	Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life
1sa	23:1	Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight
1sa	23:2	Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and
1sa	23:3	And David’s men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in
1sa	23:5	So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the
1sa	23:6	And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to
1sa	23:7	And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul
1sa	23:8	And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to
1sa	23:9	And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him;
1sa	23:10	Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath
1sa	23:11	Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul
1sa	23:12	Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men
1sa	23:13	Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and
1sa	23:14	And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained
1sa	23:15	And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David
1sa	23:16	And Jonathan Saul’s son arose, and went to David into the wood,
1sa	23:17	And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father
1sa	23:18	And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in
1sa	23:19	Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not
1sa	23:21	And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion
1sa	23:22	Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where
1sa	23:23	See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places
1sa	23:24	And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his
1sa	23:25	Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David;
1sa	23:26	And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his
1sa	23:27	But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and
1sa	23:28	Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went
1sa	23:29	And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at
1sa	24:1	And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the
1sa	24:2	Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and
1sa	24:3	And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and
1sa	24:4	And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the
1sa	24:5	And it came to pass afterward, that David’s heart smote him,
1sa	24:6	And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this
1sa	24:7	So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them
1sa	24:8	David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried
1sa	24:9	And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men’s words,
1sa	24:11	Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my
1sa	24:12	The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of
1sa	24:13	As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from
1sa	24:14	After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou
1sa	24:15	The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and
1sa	24:16	And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking
1sa	24:17	And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou
1sa	24:18	And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with
1sa	24:19	For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away?
1sa	24:20	And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and
1sa	24:21	Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut
1sa	24:22	And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his
1sa	25:1	And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together,
1sa	25:2	And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel;
1sa	25:3	Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife
1sa	25:4	And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.
1sa	25:5	And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young
1sa	25:6	And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be
1sa	25:7	And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds
1sa	25:8	Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the
1sa	25:9	And when David’s young men came, they spake to Nabal according to
1sa	25:10	And Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, Who is David? and
1sa	25:11	Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I
1sa	25:13	And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And
1sa	25:14	But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying,
1sa	25:15	But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt,
1sa	25:17	Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is
1sa	25:18	Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two
1sa	25:19	And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come
1sa	25:20	And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the
1sa	25:21	Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this
1sa	25:22	So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of
1sa	25:23	And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass,
1sa	25:24	And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let
1sa	25:25	Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even
1sa	25:26	Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul
1sa	25:27	And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my
1sa	25:28	I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the
1sa	25:29	Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the
1sa	25:30	And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my
1sa	25:32	And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel,
1sa	25:34	For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath
1sa	25:35	So David received of her hand that which she had brought him,
1sa	25:36	And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his
1sa	25:37	But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out
1sa	25:38	And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote
1sa	25:39	And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be
1sa	25:40	And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel,
1sa	25:41	And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and
1sa	25:42	And Abigail hasted, and arose and rode upon an ass, with five
1sa	25:43	David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of
1sa	25:44	But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Phalti
1sa	26:1	And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David
1sa	26:3	And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before
1sa	26:4	David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come
1sa	26:5	And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched:
1sa	26:6	Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to
1sa	26:7	So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold,
1sa	26:8	Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into
1sa	26:9	And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch
1sa	26:11	The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against
1sa	26:12	So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul’s
1sa	26:13	Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of
1sa	26:16	This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth,
1sa	26:17	And Saul knew David’s voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son
1sa	26:18	And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his
1sa	26:20	Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the
1sa	26:21	Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will
1sa	26:22	And David answered and said, Behold the king’s spear! and let
1sa	26:23	The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his
1sa	26:24	And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes,
1sa	26:25	Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou
1sa	27:1	And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the
1sa	27:2	And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that
1sa	27:3	And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man
1sa	27:4	And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought
1sa	27:5	And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine
1sa	27:7	And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines
1sa	27:8	And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and
1sa	27:9	And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive,
1sa	27:10	And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David
1sa	27:11	And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to
1sa	27:12	And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people
1sa	28:1	And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered
1sa	28:2	And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant
1sa	28:3	Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried
1sa	28:4	And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and
1sa	28:5	And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and
1sa	28:6	And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not,
1sa	28:7	Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a
1sa	28:8	And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he
1sa	28:9	And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath
1sa	28:11	Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he
1sa	28:12	And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and
1sa	28:13	And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou?
1sa	28:14	And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old
1sa	28:15	And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring
1sa	28:16	Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the
1sa	28:19	Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the
1sa	28:20	Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore
1sa	28:21	And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled,
1sa	28:22	Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of
1sa	28:23	But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants,
1sa	28:24	And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and
1sa	29:1	Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek:
1sa	29:2	And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by
1sa	29:3	Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews
1sa	29:7	Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not
1sa	29:8	And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast
1sa	29:9	And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good
1sa	29:10	Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master’s
1sa	29:11	So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to
1sa	30:1	And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag
1sa	30:3	So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned
1sa	30:4	Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their
1sa	30:5	And David’s two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the
1sa	30:6	And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning
1sa	30:7	And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech’s son, I pray
1sa	30:8	And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this
1sa	30:9	So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and
1sa	30:10	But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred
1sa	30:11	And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to
1sa	30:13	And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art
1sa	30:14	We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon
1sa	30:15	And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company?
1sa	30:16	And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread
1sa	30:17	And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of
1sa	30:18	And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away:
1sa	30:19	And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great,
1sa	30:20	And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave
1sa	30:21	And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that
1sa	30:22	Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those
1sa	30:23	Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that
1sa	30:24	For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part is
1sa	30:25	And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute
1sa	30:26	And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the
1sa	30:30	And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in
1sa	31:1	Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel
1sa	31:2	And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons;
1sa	31:3	And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him;
1sa	31:4	Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust
1sa	31:5	And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell
1sa	31:6	So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all
1sa	31:7	And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the
1sa	31:8	And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to
1sa	31:9	And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent
1sa	31:10	And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they
1sa	31:11	And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the
1sa	31:13	And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at
2sa	1:1	Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was
2sa	1:3	And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto
2sa	1:4	And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell
2sa	1:5	And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou
2sa	1:7	And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And
2sa	1:8	And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an
2sa	1:9	He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me:
2sa	1:10	So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he
2sa	1:11	Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise
2sa	1:13	And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou?
2sa	1:14	And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch
2sa	1:16	And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy
2sa	1:17	And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over
2sa	1:19	The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the
2sa	1:21	Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be
2sa	1:22	From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow
2sa	1:23	Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in
2sa	1:24	Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in
2sa	1:25	How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan,
2sa	1:26	I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast
2sa	1:27	How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished! 2:1
2sa	2:2	So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the
2sa	2:3	And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with
2sa	2:4	And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over
2sa	2:5	And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said
2sa	2:6	And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will
2sa	2:7	Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant:
2sa	2:8	But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul’s host, took Ishbosheth
2sa	2:10	Ishbosheth Saul’s son was forty years old when he began to reign
2sa	2:11	And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of
2sa	2:12	And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son
2sa	2:13	And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out,
2sa	2:14	And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play
2sa	2:15	Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin,
2sa	2:16	And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his
2sa	2:17	And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten,
2sa	2:18	And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai,
2sa	2:19	And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the
2sa	2:20	Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he
2sa	2:21	And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to
2sa	2:22	And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following
2sa	2:24	Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down
2sa	2:25	And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after
2sa	2:26	Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for
2sa	2:28	So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and
2sa	2:29	And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain,
2sa	2:30	And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered
2sa	2:31	But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner’s
2sa	2:32	And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his
2sa	3:1	Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of
2sa	3:2	And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was
2sa	3:6	And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul
2sa	3:7	And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of
2sa	3:11	And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared
2sa	3:12	And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose
2sa	3:13	And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing
2sa	3:14	And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul’s son, saying,
2sa	3:15	And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from
2sa	3:16	And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to
2sa	3:17	And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye
2sa	3:19	And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also
2sa	3:20	So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And
2sa	3:21	And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather
2sa	3:22	And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a
2sa	3:23	When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told
2sa	3:24	Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done?
2sa	3:26	And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after
2sa	3:27	And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the
2sa	3:28	And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are
2sa	3:30	So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain
2sa	3:31	And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him,
2sa	3:32	And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his
2sa	3:33	And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool
2sa	3:35	And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it
2sa	3:36	And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as
2sa	3:37	For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was
2sa	3:38	And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a
2sa	4:1	And when Saul’s son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands
2sa	4:2	And Saul’s son had two men that were captains of bands: the name
2sa	4:3	And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there
2sa	4:5	And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went,
2sa	4:6	And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they
2sa	4:7	For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his
2sa	4:8	And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and
2sa	4:9	And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of
2sa	5:1	Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and
2sa	5:2	Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that
2sa	5:3	So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king
2sa	5:4	David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
2sa	5:5	In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in
2sa	5:6	And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the
2sa	5:7	Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the
2sa	5:8	And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter,
2sa	5:9	So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And
2sa	5:10	And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was
2sa	5:11	And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees,
2sa	5:12	And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over
2sa	5:13	And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem,
2sa	5:14	And these be the names of those that were born unto him in
2sa	5:17	But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king
2sa	5:18	The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of
2sa	5:19	And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the
2sa	5:20	And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and
2sa	5:21	And there they left their images, and David and his men burned
2sa	5:22	And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in
2sa	5:23	And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go
2sa	5:24	And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops
2sa	5:25	And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the
2sa	6:1	Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel,
2sa	6:2	And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him
2sa	6:3	And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of
2sa	6:4	And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at
2sa	6:5	And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on
2sa	6:6	And when they came to Nachon’s threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his
2sa	6:7	And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote
2sa	6:8	And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon
2sa	6:9	And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the
2sa	6:11	And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the
2sa	6:12	And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the
2sa	6:13	And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had
2sa	6:14	And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David
2sa	6:15	So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the
2sa	6:16	And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal
2sa	6:17	And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place,
2sa	6:18	And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings
2sa	6:19	And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude
2sa	6:20	Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the
2sa	6:22	And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine
2sa	6:23	Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day
2sa	7:1	And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD
2sa	7:3	And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart;
2sa	7:4	And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came
2sa	7:7	In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of
2sa	7:10	Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will
2sa	7:12	And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy
2sa	7:13	He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the
2sa	7:14	I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit
2sa	7:16	And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever
2sa	7:17	According to all these words, and according to all this vision,
2sa	7:18	Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said,
2sa	7:21	For thy word’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou
2sa	7:22	Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like
2sa	7:23	And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like
2sa	7:25	And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning
2sa	7:26	And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts
2sa	7:27	For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy
2sa	7:28	And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true,
2sa	8:1	And after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines,
2sa	8:2	And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them
2sa	8:3	David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he
2sa	8:4	And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred
2sa	8:5	And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of
2sa	8:6	Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians
2sa	8:7	And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of
2sa	8:8	And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David
2sa	8:9	When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host
2sa	8:11	Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver
2sa	8:13	And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the
2sa	8:14	And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he
2sa	8:15	And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment
2sa	8:16	And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat
2sa	9:1	And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of
2sa	9:3	And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that
2sa	9:4	And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the
2sa	9:5	Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir,
2sa	9:6	Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was
2sa	9:8	And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou
2sa	9:10	Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the
2sa	9:11	Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the
2sa	9:12	And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And all
2sa	9:13	So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at
2sa	10:1	And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of
2sa	10:2	Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of
2sa	10:3	And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their
2sa	10:4	Wherefore Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved off the one
2sa	10:5	When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because the
2sa	10:6	And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David,
2sa	10:7	And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the
2sa	10:8	And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array
2sa	10:9	When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before
2sa	10:11	And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou
2sa	10:12	Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and
2sa	10:13	And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the
2sa	10:14	And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
2sa	10:15	And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel,
2sa	10:16	And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond
2sa	10:17	And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and
2sa	10:18	And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of
2sa	10:19	And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that
2sa	11:1	And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when
2sa	11:2	And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off
2sa	11:3	And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not
2sa	11:4	And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto
2sa	11:5	And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am
2sa	11:6	And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And
2sa	11:7	And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab
2sa	11:8	And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet.
2sa	11:9	But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the
2sa	11:10	And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto
2sa	11:12	And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I
2sa	11:13	And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him;
2sa	11:14	And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to
2sa	11:15	And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the
2sa	11:16	And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he
2sa	11:17	And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and
2sa	11:18	Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;
2sa	11:19	And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of
2sa	11:22	So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab
2sa	11:23	And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed
2sa	11:24	And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and
2sa	11:25	Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto
2sa	11:26	And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was
2sa	11:27	And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to
2sa	12:1	And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and
2sa	12:2	The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds: 12:3 But the
2sa	12:4	And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to
2sa	12:5	And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he
2sa	12:7	And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD
2sa	12:9	Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do
2sa	12:10	Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house;
2sa	12:11	Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee
2sa	12:12	For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all
2sa	12:13	And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And
2sa	12:14	Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to
2sa	12:15	And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the
2sa	12:16	David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted,
2sa	12:17	And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him
2sa	12:18	And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And
2sa	12:20	Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed
2sa	12:21	Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou
2sa	12:22	And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept:
2sa	12:24	And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her,
2sa	12:25	And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his
2sa	12:26	And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and
2sa	12:27	And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought
2sa	12:28	Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp
2sa	12:29	And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah,
2sa	12:30	And he took their king’s crown from off his head, the weight
2sa	12:31	And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them
2sa	13:1	And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had
2sa	13:2	And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar;
2sa	13:3	But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of
2sa	13:4	And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king’s son, lean
2sa	13:5	And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make
2sa	13:6	So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was
2sa	13:7	Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother
2sa	13:8	So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was laid down.
2sa	13:9	And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he
2sa	13:10	And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that
2sa	13:11	And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of
2sa	13:12	And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no
2sa	13:13	And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee,
2sa	13:14	Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger
2sa	13:15	Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith
2sa	13:16	And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending
2sa	13:17	Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said,
2sa	13:18	And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such
2sa	13:19	And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers
2sa	13:20	And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother
2sa	13:21	But when king David heard of all these things, he was very
2sa	13:22	And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad:
2sa	13:23	And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had
2sa	13:24	And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant
2sa	13:25	And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now
2sa	13:26	Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go
2sa	13:27	But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king’s
2sa	13:28	Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when
2sa	13:29	And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had
2sa	13:30	And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings
2sa	13:31	Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the
2sa	13:32	And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother, answered and
2sa	13:33	Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his
2sa	13:34	But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted
2sa	13:35	And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king’s sons come: as
2sa	13:36	And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking,
2sa	13:37	But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king
2sa	13:38	So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
2sa	13:39	And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for
2sa	14:1	Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was
2sa	14:2	And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and
2sa	14:4	And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her
2sa	14:5	And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I
2sa	14:6	And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in
2sa	14:7	And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid,
2sa	14:8	And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will
2sa	14:9	And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the
2sa	14:10	And the king said, Whoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to
2sa	14:11	Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy
2sa	14:12	Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one
2sa	14:13	And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a
2sa	14:14	For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground,
2sa	14:15	Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord
2sa	14:16	For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand
2sa	14:17	Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now
2sa	14:18	Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from
2sa	14:19	And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all
2sa	14:21	And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing:
2sa	14:22	And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and
2sa	14:23	So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to
2sa	14:24	And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him
2sa	14:25	But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as
2sa	14:26	And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year’s end
2sa	14:27	And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter,
2sa	14:28	So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the
2sa	14:29	Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king;
2sa	14:30	Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab’s field is near
2sa	14:31	Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said
2sa	14:33	So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called
2sa	15:1	And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him
2sa	15:2	And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate:
2sa	15:3	And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right;
2sa	15:4	Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land,
2sa	15:6	And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the
2sa	15:7	And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the
2sa	15:8	For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria,
2sa	15:9	And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to
2sa	15:10	But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel,
2sa	15:11	And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that
2sa	15:12	And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s
2sa	15:13	And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the
2sa	15:14	And David said unto all his servants that were with him at
2sa	15:15	And the king’s servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants
2sa	15:16	And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And
2sa	15:17	And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and
2sa	15:18	And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the
2sa	15:19	Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou
2sa	15:20	Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee
2sa	15:21	And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and
2sa	15:22	And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite
2sa	15:23	And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people
2sa	15:24	And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing
2sa	15:25	And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the
2sa	15:27	The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer?
2sa	15:28	See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there
2sa	15:29	Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to
2sa	15:30	And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he
2sa	15:31	And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators
2sa	15:32	And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the
2sa	15:35	And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the
2sa	15:36	Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz
2sa	15:37	So Hushai David’s friend came into the city, and Absalom came
2sa	16:1	And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold,
2sa	16:2	And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba
2sa	16:3	And the king said, And where is thy master’s son? And Ziba said
2sa	16:4	Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained
2sa	16:5	And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a
2sa	16:6	And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king
2sa	16:7	And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou
2sa	16:9	Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should
2sa	16:10	And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of
2sa	16:12	It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that
2sa	16:13	And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on
2sa	16:14	And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary,
2sa	16:15	And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to
2sa	16:16	And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend,
2sa	16:17	And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend?
2sa	16:19	And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the
2sa	16:20	Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we
2sa	16:21	And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father’s
2sa	16:22	So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and
2sa	16:23	And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those
2sa	17:1	Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out
2sa	17:4	And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of
2sa	17:5	Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us
2sa	17:6	And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him,
2sa	17:7	And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath
2sa	17:8	For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they
2sa	17:9	Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it
2sa	17:10	And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a
2sa	17:11	Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto
2sa	17:12	So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found,
2sa	17:13	Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel
2sa	17:14	And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of
2sa	17:15	Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus
2sa	17:16	Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not
2sa	17:17	Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not
2sa	17:18	Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went
2sa	17:19	And the woman took and spread a covering over the well’s mouth,
2sa	17:20	And when Absalom’s servants came to the woman to the house, they
2sa	17:21	And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up
2sa	17:22	Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and
2sa	17:23	And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he
2sa	17:24	Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he
2sa	17:25	And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab:
2sa	17:26	So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.
2sa	17:27	And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi
2sa	17:28	Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and
2sa	18:1	And David numbered the people that were with him, and set
2sa	18:2	And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of
2sa	18:3	But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee
2sa	18:4	And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And
2sa	18:5	And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal
2sa	18:6	So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the
2sa	18:8	For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the
2sa	18:9	And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a
2sa	18:10	And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw
2sa	18:11	And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou
2sa	18:12	And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand
2sa	18:13	Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life:
2sa	18:14	Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took
2sa	18:15	And ten young men that bare Joab’s armour compassed about and
2sa	18:16	And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing
2sa	18:17	And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the
2sa	18:18	Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself
2sa	18:19	Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the
2sa	18:20	And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day,
2sa	18:21	Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen.
2sa	18:22	Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But
2sa	18:24	And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to
2sa	18:25	And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If
2sa	18:26	And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman
2sa	18:27	And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost
2sa	18:28	And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he
2sa	18:29	And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz
2sa	18:30	And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he
2sa	18:31	And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the
2sa	18:32	And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And
2sa	18:33	And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the
2sa	19:2	And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the
2sa	19:3	And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as
2sa	19:4	But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud
2sa	19:7	Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy
2sa	19:8	Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all
2sa	19:9	And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of
2sa	19:10	And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now
2sa	19:12	Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then
2sa	19:14	And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the
2sa	19:15	So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to
2sa	19:16	And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim,
2sa	19:17	And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the
2sa	19:18	And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king’s
2sa	19:20	For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold,
2sa	19:21	But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not
2sa	19:24	And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and
2sa	19:25	And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the
2sa	19:27	And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my
2sa	19:28	For all of my father’s house were but dead men before my lord
2sa	19:30	And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all,
2sa	19:31	And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went
2sa	19:32	Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and
2sa	19:33	And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I
2sa	19:34	And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that
2sa	19:38	And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will
2sa	19:39	And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come
2sa	19:40	Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him:
2sa	19:41	And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said
2sa	20:1	And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was
2sa	20:2	So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed
2sa	20:3	And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the
2sa	20:4	Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within
2sa	20:5	So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer
2sa	20:6	And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do
2sa	20:7	And there went out after him Joab’s men, and the Cherethites, and
2sa	20:8	When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went
2sa	20:9	And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And Joab
2sa	20:10	But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab’s hand: so
2sa	20:11	And one of Joab’s men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth
2sa	20:12	And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And
2sa	20:13	When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on
2sa	20:14	And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to
2sa	20:15	And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they
2sa	20:16	Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray
2sa	20:17	And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou
2sa	20:18	Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time,
2sa	20:19	I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou
2sa	20:21	The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son
2sa	20:22	Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they
2sa	20:23	Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of
2sa	21:1	Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year
2sa	21:2	And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the
2sa	21:3	Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for
2sa	21:5	And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that
2sa	21:7	But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of
2sa	21:8	But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah,
2sa	21:10	And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it
2sa	21:11	And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the
2sa	21:12	And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of
2sa	21:14	And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the
2sa	21:15	Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and
2sa	21:16	And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight
2sa	21:17	But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the
2sa	21:18	And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle
2sa	21:19	And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where
2sa	21:20	And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great
2sa	21:21	And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the
2sa	21:22	These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand
2sa	22:1	And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day
2sa	22:4	I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I
2sa	22:5	When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men
2sa	22:8	Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven
2sa	22:9	There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his
2sa	22:10	He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under
2sa	22:11	And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the
2sa	22:12	And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and
2sa	22:13	Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.
2sa	22:14	The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his
2sa	22:15	And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and
2sa	22:16	And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the
2sa	22:17	He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;
2sa	22:18	He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated
2sa	22:19	They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my
2sa	22:20	He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me,
2sa	22:21	The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to
2sa	22:22	For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly
2sa	22:23	For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I
2sa	22:24	I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine
2sa	22:25	Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my
2sa	22:26	With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with the
2sa	22:27	With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward
2sa	22:28	And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are upon
2sa	22:29	For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my
2sa	22:30	For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped
2sa	22:31	As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried:
2sa	22:32	For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our God?
2sa	22:33	God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.
2sa	22:34	He maketh my feet like hinds’ feet: and setteth me upon my high
2sa	22:35	He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by
2sa	22:36	Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy
2sa	22:37	Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not
2sa	22:38	I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not
2sa	22:39	And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not
2sa	22:40	For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose
2sa	22:41	Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might
2sa	22:42	They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but
2sa	22:43	Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did
2sa	22:44	Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people,
2sa	22:45	Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear,
2sa	22:46	Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their
2sa	22:47	The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God
2sa	22:48	It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people
2sa	22:49	And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast
2sa	22:50	Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the
2sa	22:51	He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to
2sa	23:1	Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse
2sa	23:3	The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that
2sa	23:4	And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth,
2sa	23:5	Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an
2sa	23:6	But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust
2sa	23:8	These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The
2sa	23:9	And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the
2sa	23:11	And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the
2sa	23:12	But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and
2sa	23:13	And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in
2sa	23:14	And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the
2sa	23:15	And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of
2sa	23:17	And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this:
2sa	23:18	And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief
2sa	23:19	Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their
2sa	23:20	And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of
2sa	23:21	And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a
2sa	23:22	These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name
2sa	23:23	He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to
2sa	23:24	Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the
2sa	23:27	Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite, 23:28 Zalmon
2sa	24:1	And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and
2sa	24:2	For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with
2sa	24:3	And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the
2sa	24:5	And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right
2sa	24:8	So when they had gone through all the land, they came to
2sa	24:9	And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the
2sa	24:10	And David’s heart smote him after that he had numbered the
2sa	24:11	For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came
2sa	24:13	So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall
2sa	24:14	And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now
2sa	24:15	So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even
2sa	24:16	And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to
2sa	24:17	And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote
2sa	24:18	And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear
2sa	24:19	And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD
2sa	24:20	And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on
2sa	24:21	And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his
2sa	24:22	And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer
2sa	24:23	All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And
2sa	24:24	And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of
2sa	24:25	And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt
1ki	1:1	Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered
1ki	1:2	Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my
1ki	1:3	So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of
1ki	1:4	And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and
1ki	1:5	Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will
1ki	1:6	And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why
1ki	1:7	And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar
1ki	1:8	But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan
1ki	1:9	And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of
1ki	1:11	Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon,
1ki	1:13	Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not
1ki	1:15	And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the
1ki	1:16	And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the
1ki	1:18	And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king,
1ki	1:20	And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee,
1ki	1:21	Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall
1ki	1:22	And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet
1ki	1:23	And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And
1ki	1:24	And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall
1ki	1:26	But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah
1ki	1:27	Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed
1ki	1:29	And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath
1ki	1:31	Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did
1ki	1:32	And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the
1ki	1:33	The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your
1ki	1:35	Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my
1ki	1:36	And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said,
1ki	1:37	As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with
1ki	1:38	So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son
1ki	1:39	And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle,
1ki	1:40	And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with
1ki	1:41	And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as
1ki	1:43	And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king
1ki	1:44	And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the
1ki	1:45	And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him
1ki	1:46	And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.
1ki	1:47	And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king
1ki	1:48	And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel,
1ki	1:49	And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose
1ki	1:50	And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and
1ki	1:51	And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king
1ki	1:52	And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there
1ki	1:53	So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar.
1ki	2:1	Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged
1ki	2:5	Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me,
1ki	2:6	Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go
1ki	2:7	But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and
1ki	2:8	And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a
1ki	2:9	Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and
1ki	2:10	So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of
1ki	2:11	And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years:
1ki	2:12	Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his
1ki	2:13	And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of
1ki	2:14	He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said,
1ki	2:15	And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all
1ki	2:16	And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said
1ki	2:17	And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he
1ki	2:18	And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.
1ki	2:19	Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for
1ki	2:20	Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee,
1ki	2:21	And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy
1ki	2:22	And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost
1ki	2:23	Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and
1ki	2:24	Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and
1ki	2:25	And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada;
1ki	2:26	And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth,
1ki	2:27	So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD;
1ki	2:28	Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah,
1ki	2:29	And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the
1ki	2:30	And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto
1ki	2:31	And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon
1ki	2:32	And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell
1ki	2:33	Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and
1ki	2:34	So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and
1ki	2:35	And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the
1ki	2:36	And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build
1ki	2:37	For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over
1ki	2:38	And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the
1ki	2:39	And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the
1ki	2:40	And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish
1ki	2:41	And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to
1ki	2:42	And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I
1ki	2:43	Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the
1ki	2:46	So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went
1ki	3:1	And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took
1ki	3:2	Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no
1ki	3:3	And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his
1ki	3:4	And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the
1ki	3:5	In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and
1ki	3:6	And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my
1ki	3:7	And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of
1ki	3:8	And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast
1ki	3:9	Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy
1ki	3:11	And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and
1ki	3:13	And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both
1ki	3:14	And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my
1ki	3:15	And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to
1ki	3:16	Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and
1ki	3:17	And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one
1ki	3:18	And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered,
1ki	3:19	And this woman’s child died in the night; because she overlaid
1ki	3:20	And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while
1ki	3:21	And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it
1ki	3:22	And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the
1ki	3:23	Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth,
1ki	3:24	And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword
1ki	3:25	And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half
1ki	3:26	Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king,
1ki	3:27	Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and
1ki	3:28	And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged;
1ki	4:1	So king Solomon was king over all Israel.
1ki	4:2	And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok
1ki	4:4	And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok and
1ki	4:7	And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided
1ki	4:8	And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim: 4:9
1ki	4:12	Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo,
1ki	4:13	The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns of
1ki	4:15	Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of
1ki	4:20	Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in
1ki	4:21	And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the
1ki	4:22	And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine
1ki	4:24	For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river,
1ki	4:25	And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and
1ki	4:26	And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots,
1ki	4:27	And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all
1ki	4:28	Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they
1ki	4:29	And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and
1ki	4:30	And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of
1ki	4:31	For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and
1ki	4:32	And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a
1ki	4:33	And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon
1ki	4:34	And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from
1ki	5:1	And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had
1ki	5:2	And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying, 5:3 Thou knowest how that David
1ki	5:4	But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that
1ki	5:5	And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD
1ki	5:6	Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of
1ki	5:7	And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that
1ki	5:8	And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things
1ki	5:9	My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I
1ki	5:10	So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all
1ki	5:11	And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food
1ki	5:12	And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there
1ki	5:13	And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy
1ki	5:14	And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a
1ki	5:15	And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens,
1ki	5:17	And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly
1ki	5:18	And Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders did hew them, and the
1ki	6:1	And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after
1ki	6:2	And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length
1ki	6:3	And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was
1ki	6:4	And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.
1ki	6:5	And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about,
1ki	6:7	And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made
1ki	6:8	The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the
1ki	6:9	So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with
1ki	6:10	And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits
1ki	6:11	And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying, 6:12 Concerning
1ki	6:14	So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
1ki	6:15	And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar,
1ki	6:16	And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the
1ki	6:17	And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits
1ki	6:18	And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open
1ki	6:19	And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the
1ki	6:20	And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and
1ki	6:21	So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made
1ki	6:22	And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished
1ki	6:23	And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each
1ki	6:24	And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits
1ki	6:25	And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of
1ki	6:26	The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the
1ki	6:27	And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they
1ki	6:28	And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.
1ki	6:29	And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved
1ki	6:30	And the floors of the house he overlaid with gold, within and
1ki	6:31	And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree:
1ki	6:32	The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them
1ki	6:33	So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a
1ki	6:34	And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one
1ki	6:35	And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers:
1ki	6:36	And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and
1ki	6:37	In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD
1ki	7:1	But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he
1ki	7:2	He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length
1ki	7:3	And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on
1ki	7:4	And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light
1ki	7:5	And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and
1ki	7:6	And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty
1ki	7:7	Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the
1ki	7:8	And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch,
1ki	7:9	All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of
1ki	7:10	And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones,
1ki	7:11	And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones,
1ki	7:12	And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed
1ki	7:13	And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
1ki	7:14	He was a widow’s son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was
1ki	7:15	For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece:
1ki	7:16	And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops
1ki	7:18	And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one
1ki	7:19	And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of
1ki	7:20	And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also
1ki	7:21	And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set
1ki	7:22	And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of
1ki	7:23	And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the
1ki	7:24	And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing
1ki	7:25	It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and
1ki	7:26	And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was
1ki	7:27	And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one
1ki	7:28	And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders,
1ki	7:30	And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and
1ki	7:31	And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit:
1ki	7:32	And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the
1ki	7:33	And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel:
1ki	7:34	And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base:
1ki	7:35	And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a
1ki	7:36	For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders
1ki	7:37	After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one
1ki	7:38	Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty
1ki	7:39	And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on
1ki	7:40	And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So
1ki	7:46	In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground
1ki	7:47	And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were
1ki	7:48	And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of
1ki	7:51	So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of
1ki	8:1	Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of
1ki	8:2	And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon
1ki	8:3	And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the
1ki	8:4	And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the
1ki	8:5	And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were
1ki	8:6	And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD
1ki	8:7	For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of
1ki	8:8	And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were
1ki	8:9	There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which
1ki	8:10	And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy
1ki	8:12	Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the
1ki	8:13	I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place
1ki	8:14	And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the
1ki	8:15	And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake with
1ki	8:17	And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for
1ki	8:18	And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine
1ki	8:19	Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that
1ki	8:20	And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am
1ki	8:21	And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant
1ki	8:22	And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of
1ki	8:24	Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou
1ki	8:25	Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my
1ki	8:26	And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified,
1ki	8:27	But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and
1ki	8:29	That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even
1ki	8:30	And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy
1ki	8:31	If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid
1ki	8:33	When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because
1ki	8:35	When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have
1ki	8:37	If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting,
1ki	8:39	Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do,
1ki	8:41	Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel,
1ki	8:43	Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all
1ki	8:44	If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever
1ki	8:46	If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,)
1ki	8:47	Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they
1ki	8:49	Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy
1ki	8:51	For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou
1ki	8:52	That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant,
1ki	8:53	For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the
1ki	8:54	And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all
1ki	8:55	And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a
1ki	8:57	The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him
1ki	8:59	And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before
1ki	8:61	Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to
1ki	8:62	And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before
1ki	8:63	And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he
1ki	8:64	The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was
1ki	8:65	And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a
1ki	8:66	On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the
1ki	9:1	And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the
1ki	9:3	And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy
1ki	9:4	And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in
1ki	9:6	But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your
1ki	9:7	Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given
1ki	9:10	And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had
1ki	9:11	(Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar
1ki	9:12	And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had
1ki	9:13	And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my
1ki	9:14	And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.
1ki	9:15	And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for
1ki	9:16	For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt
1ki	9:17	And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether, 9:18 And
1ki	9:20	And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites,
1ki	9:22	But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but
1ki	9:23	These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon’s
1ki	9:24	But Pharaoh’s daughter came up out of the city of David unto her
1ki	9:25	And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and
1ki	9:26	And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is
1ki	9:27	And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had
1ki	9:28	And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four
1ki	10:1	And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon
1ki	10:2	And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels
1ki	10:3	And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing
1ki	10:4	And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon’s wisdom, and
1ki	10:6	And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in
1ki	10:7	Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had
1ki	10:8	Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand
1ki	10:9	Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee
1ki	10:10	And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and
1ki	10:11	And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir,
1ki	10:12	And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of
1ki	10:13	And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire,
1ki	10:14	Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six
1ki	10:16	And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six
1ki	10:17	And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of
1ki	10:18	Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it
1ki	10:19	The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round
1ki	10:20	And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other
1ki	10:21	And all king Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all
1ki	10:22	For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of
1ki	10:23	So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches
1ki	10:24	And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which
1ki	10:25	And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and
1ki	10:26	And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had
1ki	10:27	And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and
1ki	10:28	And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the
1ki	10:29	And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred
1ki	11:1	But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the
1ki	11:3	And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred
1ki	11:4	For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned
1ki	11:5	For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians,
1ki	11:6	And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully
1ki	11:7	Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination
1ki	11:8	And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt
1ki	11:9	And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned
1ki	11:11	Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done
1ki	11:12	Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy
1ki	11:13	Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one
1ki	11:14	And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the
1ki	11:15	For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the
1ki	11:18	And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took
1ki	11:19	And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he
1ki	11:20	And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom
1ki	11:21	And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers,
1ki	11:22	Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me,
1ki	11:23	And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of
1ki	11:25	And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon,
1ki	11:26	And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda,
1ki	11:27	And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the
1ki	11:28	And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon
1ki	11:29	And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of
1ki	11:34	Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I
1ki	11:35	But I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will give
1ki	11:36	And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant
1ki	11:37	And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that
1ki	11:38	And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command
1ki	11:39	And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.
1ki	11:40	Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose,
1ki	11:41	And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and
1ki	11:42	And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel
1ki	11:43	And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city
1ki	12:1	And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem
1ki	12:2	And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet
1ki	12:5	And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again
1ki	12:6	And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before
1ki	12:8	But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given
1ki	12:11	And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will
1ki	12:12	So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day,
1ki	12:13	And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old
1ki	12:15	Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause
1ki	12:16	So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them,
1ki	12:17	But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of
1ki	12:18	Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and
1ki	12:19	So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
1ki	12:20	And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was
1ki	12:21	And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the
1ki	12:22	But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
1ki	12:23	Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto
1ki	12:25	Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein;
1ki	12:26	And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to
1ki	12:28	Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold,
1ki	12:29	And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.
1ki	12:30	And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship
1ki	12:31	And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the
1ki	12:32	And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the
1ki	12:33	So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the
1ki	13:1	And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of
1ki	13:2	And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said,
1ki	13:3	And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which
1ki	13:4	And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the
1ki	13:5	The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar,
1ki	13:6	And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now
1ki	13:7	And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and
1ki	13:8	And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half
1ki	13:10	So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came
1ki	13:11	Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and
1ki	13:12	And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons
1ki	13:13	And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled
1ki	13:15	Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.
1ki	13:16	And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee:
1ki	13:17	For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no
1ki	13:18	He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel
1ki	13:19	So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and
1ki	13:20	And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of
1ki	13:23	And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had
1ki	13:24	And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him:
1ki	13:25	And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way,
1ki	13:26	And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard
1ki	13:27	And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they
1ki	13:28	And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass
1ki	13:29	And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid
1ki	13:30	And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over
1ki	13:33	After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but
1ki	13:34	And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to
1ki	14:1	At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.
1ki	14:2	And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise
1ki	14:3	And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of
1ki	14:4	And Jeroboam’s wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and
1ki	14:5	And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam
1ki	14:6	And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she
1ki	14:7	Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch
1ki	14:11	Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and
1ki	14:12	Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when thy
1ki	14:13	And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of
1ki	14:14	Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who
1ki	14:15	For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the
1ki	14:16	And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who
1ki	14:17	And Jeroboam’s wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and
1ki	14:19	And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he
1ki	14:20	And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years:
1ki	14:21	And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was
1ki	14:22	And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked
1ki	14:23	For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on
1ki	14:24	And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did
1ki	14:25	And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that
1ki	14:27	And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and
1ki	14:28	And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD,
1ki	14:29	Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are
1ki	14:30	And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.
1ki	14:31	And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his

1ki	15:2	Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. and his mother’s name was
1ki	15:3	And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done
1ki	15:4	Nevertheless for David’s sake did the LORD his God give him a

1ki	15:8	And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the
1ki	15:9	And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa
1ki	15:10	And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his
1ki	15:11	And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did
1ki	15:12	And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all
1ki	15:13	And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being
1ki	15:14	But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa’s heart
1ki	15:15	And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and
1ki	15:16	And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all
1ki	15:17	And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built
1ki	15:18	Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the
1ki	15:20	So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of
1ki	15:21	And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off
1ki	15:22	Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was
1ki	15:23	The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that
1ki	15:24	And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers
1ki	15:25	And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the
1ki	15:26	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way
1ki	15:27	And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar,
1ki	15:28	Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him,
1ki	15:29	And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the
1ki	15:31	Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they
1ki	15:32	And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all
1ki	15:33	In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of
1ki	15:34	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way
1ki	16:1	Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against
1ki	16:4	Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him
1ki	16:5	Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his
1ki	16:7	And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came
1ki	16:8	In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the
1ki	16:9	And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired
1ki	16:10	And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty
1ki	16:11	And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat
1ki	16:12	Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the
1ki	16:13	For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by

1ki	16:15	In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri
1ki	16:16	And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath
1ki	16:17	And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and
1ki	16:18	And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken,
1ki	16:19	For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the
1ki	16:20	Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he
1ki	16:22	But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people
1ki	16:23	In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to
1ki	16:24	And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of
1ki	16:25	But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse
1ki	16:26	For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and
1ki	16:27	Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might
1ki	16:29	And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began
1ki	16:30	And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above
1ki	16:31	And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to
1ki	16:32	And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which
1ki	16:33	And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God
1ki	16:34	In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the
1ki	17:1	And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead,
1ki	17:2	And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, 17:3 Get thee
1ki	17:4	And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have
1ki	17:5	So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he
1ki	17:6	And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and
1ki	17:7	And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up,
1ki	17:8	And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, 17:9 Arise, get
1ki	17:10	So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate
1ki	17:11	And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said,
1ki	17:12	And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but
1ki	17:13	And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said:
1ki	17:14	For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall
1ki	17:15	And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she,
1ki	17:16	And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil
1ki	17:17	And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the
1ki	17:18	And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou
1ki	17:20	And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou
1ki	17:22	And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the
1ki	17:23	And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the
1ki	17:24	And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a
1ki	18:1	And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD
1ki	18:2	And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore
1ki	18:3	And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house.
1ki	18:6	So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab
1ki	18:7	And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he
1ki	18:9	And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy
1ki	18:11	And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.
1ki	18:12	And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that
1ki	18:13	Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the
1ki	18:15	And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I
1ki	18:16	So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to
1ki	18:17	And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto
1ki	18:19	Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount
1ki	18:20	So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the
1ki	18:21	And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye
1ki	18:22	Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a
1ki	18:23	Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one
1ki	18:25	And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one
1ki	18:26	And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed
1ki	18:27	And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said,
1ki	18:28	And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with
1ki	18:29	And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied
1ki	18:30	And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all
1ki	18:31	And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the
1ki	18:33	And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and
1ki	18:34	And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second
1ki	18:35	And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the
1ki	18:36	And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening
1ki	18:37	Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou
1ki	18:38	Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt
1ki	18:39	And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and
1ki	18:40	And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not
1ki	18:41	And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there
1ki	18:42	So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the
1ki	18:44	And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold,
1ki	18:45	And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black
1ki	18:46	And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his
1ki	19:1	And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he
1ki	19:2	Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the
1ki	19:3	And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came
1ki	19:4	But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came
1ki	19:5	And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an
1ki	19:6	And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals,
1ki	19:7	And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched
1ki	19:8	And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of
1ki	19:9	And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold,
1ki	19:11	And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD.
1ki	19:13	And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in
1ki	19:15	And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the
1ki	19:17	And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of
1ki	19:18	Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which
1ki	19:19	So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who
1ki	19:20	And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I
1ki	19:21	And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew
1ki	20:1	And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together:
1ki	20:2	And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and
1ki	20:4	And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king,
1ki	20:5	And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Benhadad,
1ki	20:7	Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and
1ki	20:8	And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not
1ki	20:9	Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my lord
1ki	20:10	And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me,
1ki	20:11	And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him
1ki	20:12	And it came to pass, when Benhadad heard this message, as he
1ki	20:13	And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel,
1ki	20:14	And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Even
1ki	20:15	Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces,
1ki	20:16	And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was drinking himself
1ki	20:17	And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out
1ki	20:18	And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them
1ki	20:19	So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of
1ki	20:20	And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and
1ki	20:21	And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and
1ki	20:22	And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him,
1ki	20:23	And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods
1ki	20:24	And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his
1ki	20:26	And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad
1ki	20:27	And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present,
1ki	20:28	And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel,
1ki	20:29	And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so
1ki	20:30	But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell
1ki	20:31	And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that
1ki	20:32	So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their
1ki	20:33	Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come
1ki	20:34	And Benhadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took
1ki	20:35	And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his
1ki	20:36	Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of
1ki	20:37	Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And
1ki	20:38	So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and
1ki	20:39	And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said,
1ki	20:40	And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the
1ki	20:41	And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the
1ki	20:42	And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let
1ki	20:43	And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased,
1ki	21:1	And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the
1ki	21:2	And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I
1ki	21:3	And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should
1ki	21:4	And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the
1ki	21:5	But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy
1ki	21:7	And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the
1ki	21:8	So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, and sealed them with his
1ki	21:9	And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set
1ki	21:11	And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were
1ki	21:12	They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.
1ki	21:13	And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before
1ki	21:14	Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is
1ki	21:15	And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned,
1ki	21:16	And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that
1ki	21:17	And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
1ki	21:18	Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria:
1ki	21:19	And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast
1ki	21:20	And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And
1ki	21:21	Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy
1ki	21:23	And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat
1ki	21:24	Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him
1ki	21:25	But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to
1ki	21:26	And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all
1ki	21:27	And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent
1ki	21:28	And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
1ki	21:29	Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he
1ki	22:1	And they continued three years without war between Syria and
1ki	22:2	And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king
1ki	22:3	And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that
1ki	22:5	And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray
1ki	22:6	Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about
1ki	22:7	And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD
1ki	22:9	Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten
1ki	22:10	And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat
1ki	22:11	And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he
1ki	22:12	And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to
1ki	22:13	And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him,
1ki	22:14	And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto
1ki	22:15	So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah,
1ki	22:16	And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee
1ki	22:18	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell
1ki	22:20	And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up
1ki	22:21	And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and
1ki	22:22	And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go
1ki	22:23	Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the
1ki	22:24	But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah
1ki	22:26	And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back
1ki	22:28	And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath
1ki	22:29	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up
1ki	22:30	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise
1ki	22:31	But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that
1ki	22:32	And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw
1ki	22:33	And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived
1ki	22:34	And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of
1ki	22:35	And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in
1ki	22:36	And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the
1ki	22:37	So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried
1ki	22:38	And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs
1ki	22:39	Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the
1ki	22:40	So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in
1ki	22:41	And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the
1ki	22:42	Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to
1ki	22:43	And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not
1ki	22:44	And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
1ki	22:45	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he
1ki	22:47	There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.
1ki	22:48	Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but
1ki	22:49	Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my
1ki	22:50	And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
1ki	22:51	Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria
1ki	22:52	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way
2ki	1:1	Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
2ki	1:2	And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that
2ki	1:3	But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go
2ki	1:5	And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them,
2ki	1:7	And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up to
2ki	1:9	Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And
2ki	1:10	And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a
2ki	1:11	Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his
2ki	1:12	And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let
2ki	1:13	And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty.
2ki	1:14	Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two
2ki	1:15	And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be
2ki	1:16	And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast
2ki	1:17	So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had
2ki	1:18	Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not
2ki	2:2	And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD
2ki	2:3	And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to
2ki	2:4	And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the
2ki	2:5	And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha,
2ki	2:6	And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD
2ki	2:7	And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view
2ki	2:8	And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the
2ki	2:9	And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said
2ki	2:10	And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou
2ki	2:11	And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that,
2ki	2:12	And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the
2ki	2:13	He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went
2ki	2:15	And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho
2ki	2:16	And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants
2ki	2:17	And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They
2ki	2:18	And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he
2ki	2:20	And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they
2ki	2:21	And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the
2ki	2:22	So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying
2ki	2:23	And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by
2ki	2:24	And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the
2ki	2:25	And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he
2ki	3:1	Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria
2ki	3:2	And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his
2ki	3:3	Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of
2ki	3:4	And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the
2ki	3:5	But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab
2ki	3:6	And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered
2ki	3:7	And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The
2ki	3:8	And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way
2ki	3:9	So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of
2ki	3:10	And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called
2ki	3:11	But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD,
2ki	3:12	And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the
2ki	3:13	And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with
2ki	3:14	And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I
2ki	3:15	But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the
2ki	3:16	And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of
2ki	3:17	For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye
2ki	3:18	And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will
2ki	3:19	And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and
2ki	3:20	And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was
2ki	3:21	And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to
2ki	3:22	And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the
2ki	3:24	And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up
2ki	3:25	And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land
2ki	3:26	And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for
2ki	3:27	Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his
2ki	4:1	Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the
2ki	4:2	And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what
2ki	4:3	Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy
2ki	4:4	And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and
2ki	4:5	So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her
2ki	4:6	And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said
2ki	4:7	Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the
2ki	4:8	And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a
2ki	4:9	And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is
2ki	4:10	Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let
2ki	4:11	And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into
2ki	4:12	And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when
2ki	4:13	And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been
2ki	4:14	And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi
2ki	4:15	And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in
2ki	4:16	And he said, About this season, according to the time of life,
2ki	4:17	And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that
2ki	4:18	And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out
2ki	4:19	And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a
2ki	4:20	And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat
2ki	4:21	And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and
2ki	4:22	And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee,
2ki	4:23	And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? it is neither
2ki	4:24	Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go
2ki	4:25	So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it
2ki	4:28	Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do
2ki	4:30	And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy
2ki	4:31	And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the
2ki	4:32	And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was
2ki	4:33	He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and
2ki	4:34	And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon
2ki	4:35	Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went
2ki	4:36	And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he
2ki	4:37	Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the
2ki	4:38	And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the
2ki	4:39	And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild
2ki	4:40	So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as
2ki	4:41	But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he
2ki	4:42	And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of
2ki	4:43	And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred
2ki	4:44	So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof,
2ki	5:1	Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great
2ki	5:2	And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away
2ki	5:3	And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the
2ki	5:4	And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the
2ki	5:5	And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter
2ki	5:6	And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when
2ki	5:7	And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter,
2ki	5:8	And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king
2ki	5:9	So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at
2ki	5:10	And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in
2ki	5:11	But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought,
2ki	5:12	Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all
2ki	5:13	And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My
2ki	5:15	And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and
2ki	5:16	But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will
2ki	5:17	And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to
2ki	5:18	In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master
2ki	5:19	And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a
2ki	5:20	But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold,
2ki	5:21	So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running
2ki	5:23	And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him,
2ki	5:24	And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and
2ki	5:25	But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto
2ki	5:26	And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man
2ki	6:1	And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the
2ki	6:2	Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a
2ki	6:3	And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants.
2ki	6:4	So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down
2ki	6:5	But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water:
2ki	6:6	And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the
2ki	6:7	Therefore said he, Take it up to thee. And he put out his hand,
2ki	6:8	Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel
2ki	6:9	And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware
2ki	6:10	And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God
2ki	6:11	Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for
2ki	6:13	And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch
2ki	6:14	Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host:
2ki	6:15	And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone
2ki	6:17	And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes,
2ki	6:18	And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and
2ki	6:19	And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this
2ki	6:20	And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that
2ki	6:21	And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My
2ki	6:23	And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten
2ki	6:24	And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria
2ki	6:25	And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they
2ki	6:26	And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there
2ki	6:27	And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help
2ki	6:29	So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the
2ki	6:30	And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman,
2ki	6:31	Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of
2ki	6:32	But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the
2ki	7:2	Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God,
2ki	7:3	And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate:
2ki	7:5	And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the
2ki	7:6	For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of
2ki	7:7	Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their
2ki	7:8	And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they
2ki	7:9	Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day
2ki	7:10	So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they
2ki	7:11	And he called the porters; and they told it to the king’s house
2ki	7:12	And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I
2ki	7:13	And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray
2ki	7:14	They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after
2ki	7:15	And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was
2ki	7:16	And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So
2ki	7:17	And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have
2ki	7:18	And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king,
2ki	7:20	And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the
2ki	8:1	Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to
2ki	8:2	And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God:
2ki	8:3	And it came to pass at the seven years’ end, that the woman
2ki	8:4	And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God,
2ki	8:5	And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had
2ki	8:6	And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king
2ki	8:7	And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was
2ki	8:8	And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and
2ki	8:11	And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed:
2ki	8:12	And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I
2ki	8:13	And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should
2ki	8:14	So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to
2ki	8:15	And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth,
2ki	8:16	And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel,
2ki	8:17	Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he
2ki	8:18	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house
2ki	8:19	Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant’s
2ki	8:20	In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made
2ki	8:21	So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he
2ki	8:22	Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day.
2ki	8:23	And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they
2ki	8:25	In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did
2ki	8:26	Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and
2ki	8:27	And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in
2ki	8:28	And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael
2ki	8:29	And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds
2ki	9:1	And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets,
2ki	9:4	So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to
2ki	9:5	And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting;
2ki	9:6	And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on
2ki	9:7	And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may
2ki	9:8	For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from
2ki	9:11	Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said
2ki	9:12	And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and
2ki	9:13	Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it
2ki	9:14	So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired
2ki	9:15	But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds
2ki	9:16	So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay
2ki	9:17	And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied
2ki	9:19	Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and
2ki	9:20	And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh
2ki	9:21	And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And
2ki	9:22	And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it
2ki	9:24	And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram
2ki	9:25	Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in
2ki	9:27	But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way
2ki	9:28	And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and
2ki	9:29	And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah
2ki	9:30	And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she
2ki	9:31	And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace,
2ki	9:33	And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of
2ki	9:34	And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see
2ki	9:35	And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the
2ki	9:36	Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the
2ki	9:37	And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the
2ki	10:1	And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and
2ki	10:4	But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings
2ki	10:6	Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be
2ki	10:7	And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took
2ki	10:8	And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have
2ki	10:9	And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood,
2ki	10:11	So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel,
2ki	10:12	And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at
2ki	10:14	And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew
2ki	10:15	And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son
2ki	10:16	And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they
2ki	10:17	And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab
2ki	10:18	And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them,
2ki	10:19	Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his
2ki	10:20	And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they
2ki	10:21	And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of
2ki	10:22	And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth
2ki	10:23	And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house
2ki	10:24	And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings,
2ki	10:25	And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering
2ki	10:26	And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and
2ki	10:27	And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the house
2ki	10:28	Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.
2ki	10:29	Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made
2ki	10:30	And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in
2ki	10:31	But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of
2ki	10:32	In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael
2ki	10:34	Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all
2ki	10:36	And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty
2ki	11:1	And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was
2ki	11:2	But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah,
2ki	11:3	And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years. And
2ki	11:4	And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over
2ki	11:5	And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall
2ki	11:7	And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they
2ki	11:8	And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his
2ki	11:9	And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things
2ki	11:10	And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king
2ki	11:11	And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand,
2ki	11:12	And he brought forth the king’s son, and put the crown upon him,
2ki	11:13	And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the
2ki	11:14	And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the
2ki	11:15	But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds,
2ki	11:16	And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which
2ki	11:17	And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and
2ki	11:18	And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and
2ki	11:19	And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the
2ki	11:20	And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in
2ki	11:21	Seven years old was Jehoash when he began to reign.
2ki	12:1	In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty
2ki	12:2	And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all
2ki	12:3	But the high places were not taken away: the people still
2ki	12:4	And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated
2ki	12:6	But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king
2ki	12:7	Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the other
2ki	12:8	And the priests consented to receive no more money of the people,
2ki	12:9	But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid
2ki	12:10	And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the
2ki	12:11	And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them that
2ki	12:13	Howbeit there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of
2ki	12:14	But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the
2ki	12:15	Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they
2ki	12:16	The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house
2ki	12:17	Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and
2ki	12:18	And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that
2ki	12:19	And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they
2ki	12:20	And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in
2ki	12:21	For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of
2ki	13:1	In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king
2ki	13:2	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and
2ki	13:3	And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he
2ki	13:4	And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto him:
2ki	13:5	(And the LORD gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from
2ki	13:6	Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of
2ki	13:8	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and
2ki	13:10	In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began
2ki	13:11	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he
2ki	13:12	And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his
2ki	13:14	Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And
2ki	13:15	And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took unto
2ki	13:16	And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the bow.
2ki	13:17	And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then
2ki	13:18	And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said unto
2ki	13:19	And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest
2ki	13:20	And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the
2ki	13:21	And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold,
2ki	13:22	But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of
2ki	13:23	And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them,
2ki	13:24	So Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in
2ki	13:25	And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of
2ki	14:1	In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel
2ki	14:2	He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and
2ki	14:3	And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet not
2ki	14:4	Howbeit the high places were not taken away: as yet the people
2ki	14:5	And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his
2ki	14:6	But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto
2ki	14:7	He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took
2ki	14:8	Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son
2ki	14:9	And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah,
2ki	14:10	Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted thee
2ki	14:11	But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel
2ki	14:12	And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled
2ki	14:13	And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son
2ki	14:14	And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that
2ki	14:15	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might,
2ki	14:17	And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death
2ki	14:18	And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the
2ki	14:20	And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem
2ki	14:21	And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which was sixteen
2ki	14:22	He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king
2ki	14:23	In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah
2ki	14:24	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
2ki	14:25	He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto
2ki	14:26	For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very
2ki	14:27	And the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of Israel
2ki	14:28	Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and
2ki	15:1	In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began
2ki	15:2	Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned
2ki	15:3	And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
2ki	15:5	And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day
2ki	15:6	And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are
2ki	15:7	So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his
2ki	15:8	In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did
2ki	15:9	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his
2ki	15:10	And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote
2ki	15:11	And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they are written
2ki	15:12	This was the word of the LORD which he spake unto Jehu, saying,
2ki	15:13	Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and
2ki	15:14	For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to
2ki	15:15	And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he
2ki	15:16	Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the
2ki	15:17	In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began
2ki	15:18	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
2ki	15:19	And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem
2ki	15:20	And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty
2ki	15:21	And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are
2ki	15:22	And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned
2ki	15:23	In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son
2ki	15:24	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
2ki	15:25	But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired
2ki	15:26	And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did,
2ki	15:27	In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the
2ki	15:28	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
2ki	15:29	In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of
2ki	15:30	And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the
2ki	15:31	And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold,
2ki	15:32	In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel
2ki	15:33	Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he
2ki	15:34	And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD: he did
2ki	15:35	Howbeit the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed
2ki	15:36	Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are
2ki	15:37	In those days the LORD began to send against Judah Rezin the
2ki	15:38	And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
2ki	16:1	In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son
2ki	16:2	Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned
2ki	16:3	But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made
2ki	16:4	And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on
2ki	16:5	Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel
2ki	16:6	At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and
2ki	16:7	So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria,
2ki	16:8	And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of
2ki	16:9	And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of
2ki	16:10	And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of
2ki	16:11	And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king
2ki	16:12	And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the
2ki	16:13	And he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and
2ki	16:14	And he brought also the brasen altar, which was before the LORD,
2ki	16:15	And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the
2ki	16:16	Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz
2ki	16:17	And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the
2ki	16:18	And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house,
2ki	16:19	Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not
2ki	17:1	In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of
2ki	17:2	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but not
2ki	17:3	Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea
2ki	17:4	And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had
2ki	17:5	Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and
2ki	17:6	In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and
2ki	17:7	For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the
2ki	17:9	And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were
2ki	17:10	And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and
2ki	17:13	Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all
2ki	17:14	Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks,
2ki	17:15	And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made
2ki	17:16	And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and
2ki	17:17	And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through
2ki	17:18	Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them
2ki	17:19	Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but
2ki	17:20	And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted
2ki	17:21	For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made
2ki	17:22	For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam
2ki	17:24	And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from
2ki	17:25	And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that
2ki	17:26	Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations
2ki	17:27	Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of
2ki	17:28	Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria
2ki	17:29	Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the
2ki	17:30	And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth
2ki	17:32	So they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the lowest
2ki	17:33	They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the
2ki	17:34	Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not
2ki	17:37	And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the
2ki	17:38	And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget;
2ki	17:39	But the LORD your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you
2ki	17:40	Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former
2ki	17:41	So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven
2ki	18:1	Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king
2ki	18:2	Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he
2ki	18:3	And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
2ki	18:4	He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down
2ki	18:5	He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none
2ki	18:6	For he clave to the LORD, and departed not from following him,
2ki	18:7	And the LORD was with him; and he prospered whithersoever he went
2ki	18:8	He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders
2ki	18:9	And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which
2ki	18:10	And at the end of three years they took it: even in the sixth
2ki	18:11	And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and
2ki	18:13	Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king
2ki	18:14	And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to
2ki	18:15	And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house
2ki	18:16	At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the
2ki	18:17	And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh
2ki	18:18	And when they had called to the king, there came out to them
2ki	18:19	And Rabshakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus
2ki	18:22	But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not that
2ki	18:24	How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the
2ki	18:26	Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto
2ki	18:27	But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy
2ki	18:31	Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria,
2ki	18:33	Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land
2ki	18:37	Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the
2ki	19:1	And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent
2ki	19:2	And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna the
2ki	19:3	And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of
2ki	19:4	It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh,
2ki	19:5	So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
2ki	19:6	And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus
2ki	19:7	Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour,
2ki	19:8	So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring
2ki	19:9	And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is
2ki	19:11	Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to
2ki	19:12	Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers
2ki	19:15	And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of
2ki	19:16	LORD, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes, and
2ki	19:17	Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the
2ki	19:19	Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out
2ki	19:20	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith
2ki	19:21	This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The
2ki	19:22	Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast
2ki	19:23	By thy messengers thou hast reproached the LORD, and hast said,
2ki	19:24	I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my
2ki	19:25	Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it, and of ancient
2ki	19:26	Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were
2ki	19:27	But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and
2ki	19:28	Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine
2ki	19:29	And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such
2ki	19:30	And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet
2ki	19:31	For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that
2ki	19:32	Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He
2ki	19:33	By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall
2ki	19:34	For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and
2ki	19:35	And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went
2ki	19:36	So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned,
2ki	19:37	And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of
2ki	20:1	In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet
2ki	20:2	Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,
2ki	20:4	And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle
2ki	20:6	And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver
2ki	20:7	And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it
2ki	20:8	And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the
2ki	20:11	And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the
2ki	20:12	At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of
2ki	20:13	And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the house
2ki	20:14	Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto
2ki	20:15	And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah
2ki	20:16	And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD.
2ki	20:17	Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that
2ki	20:18	And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt
2ki	20:19	Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD
2ki	21:1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and reigned
2ki	21:2	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after
2ki	21:3	For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father
2ki	21:4	And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD
2ki	21:5	And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts
2ki	21:6	And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times,
2ki	21:7	And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the
2ki	21:9	But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil
2ki	21:10	And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, saying, 21:11
2ki	21:13	And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the
2ki	21:14	And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver
2ki	21:16	Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had
2ki	21:17	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and
2ki	21:19	Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he
2ki	21:20	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his
2ki	21:21	And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and
2ki	21:23	And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the
2ki	21:24	And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired
2ki	21:25	Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not
2ki	22:1	Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
2ki	22:2	And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and
2ki	22:3	And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that
2ki	22:7	Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that
2ki	22:8	And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have
2ki	22:9	And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king
2ki	22:10	And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the
2ki	22:11	And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the
2ki	22:12	And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of
2ki	22:14	So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and
2ki	22:15	And she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell
2ki	22:18	But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the LORD,
2ki	22:20	Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou
2ki	23:1	And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of
2ki	23:2	And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men
2ki	23:3	And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the
2ki	23:4	And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests
2ki	23:5	And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah
2ki	23:6	And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without
2ki	23:7	And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the
2ki	23:8	And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and
2ki	23:9	Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the
2ki	23:10	And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children
2ki	23:11	And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to
2ki	23:12	And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of
2ki	23:13	And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on
2ki	23:14	And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and
2ki	23:15	Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which
2ki	23:16	And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were
2ki	23:17	Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of the
2ki	23:18	And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they
2ki	23:19	And all the houses also of the high places that were in the
2ki	23:20	And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there
2ki	23:21	And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover
2ki	23:22	Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the
2ki	23:24	Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and
2ki	23:25	And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to
2ki	23:26	Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his
2ki	23:27	And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as
2ki	23:28	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are
2ki	23:29	In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king
2ki	23:30	And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and
2ki	23:31	Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign;
2ki	23:32	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
2ki	23:33	And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of
2ki	23:34	And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the
2ki	23:35	And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he
2ki	23:36	Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign;
2ki	23:37	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
2ki	24:1	In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim
2ki	24:2	And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of
2ki	24:3	Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Judah, to
2ki	24:5	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are
2ki	24:6	So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son
2ki	24:7	And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land:
2ki	24:8	Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he
2ki	24:9	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
2ki	24:10	At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came
2ki	24:11	And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and
2ki	24:12	And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of
2ki	24:13	And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the
2ki	24:14	And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all
2ki	24:15	And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king’s
2ki	24:16	And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen and
2ki	24:17	And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father’s brother king
2ki	24:18	Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign,
2ki	24:19	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
2ki	24:20	For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem
2ki	25:1	And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth
2ki	25:2	And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king
2ki	25:3	And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in
2ki	25:4	And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night
2ki	25:5	And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook
2ki	25:6	So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon
2ki	25:7	And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out
2ki	25:8	And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is
2ki	25:10	And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of
2ki	25:11	Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the
2ki	25:12	But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be
2ki	25:13	And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and
2ki	25:14	And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons,
2ki	25:15	And the firepans, and the bowls, and such things as were of
2ki	25:16	The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made
2ki	25:17	The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the
2ki	25:18	And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and
2ki	25:22	And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom
2ki	25:23	And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men,
2ki	25:24	And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto
2ki	25:25	But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son
2ki	25:26	And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of

1ch	12:2	They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and
1ch	12:3	The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the
1ch	12:4	And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and
1ch	12:8	And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into the
1ch	12:9	Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third, 12:10
1ch	12:14	These were of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of the
1ch	12:15	These are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it
1ch	12:16	And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold
1ch	12:17	And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto
1ch	12:18	Then the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the captains,
1ch	12:19	And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the
1ch	12:20	As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and
1ch	12:21	And they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they
1ch	12:22	For at that time day by day there came to David to help him,
1ch	12:23	And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to
1ch	12:24	The children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six
1ch	12:25	Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war,
1ch	12:26	Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.
1ch	12:27	And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites, and with him were
1ch	12:29	And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three
1ch	12:30	And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight
1ch	12:31	And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which were
1ch	12:32	And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had
1ch	12:33	Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with
1ch	12:34	And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield
1ch	12:35	And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and
1ch	12:36	And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, forty
1ch	12:37	And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the
1ch	12:38	All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect
1ch	12:39	And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking:
1ch	12:40	Moreover they that were nigh them, even unto Issachar and
1ch	13:1	And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds,
1ch	13:2	And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem
1ch	13:3	And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired
1ch	13:4	And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the
1ch	13:5	So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even
1ch	13:6	And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to
1ch	13:7	And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of
1ch	13:8	And David and all Israel played before God with all their might,
1ch	13:9	And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put
1ch	13:10	And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote
1ch	13:11	And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach
1ch	13:12	And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring
1ch	13:14	And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his
1ch	14:1	Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of
1ch	14:2	And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over
1ch	14:3	And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons
1ch	14:4	Now these are the names of his children which he had in
1ch	14:8	And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over
1ch	14:9	And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of
1ch	14:10	And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the
1ch	14:11	So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then
1ch	14:12	And when they had left their gods there, David gave a
1ch	14:13	And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the
1ch	14:14	Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go
1ch	14:15	And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the
1ch	14:16	David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the
1ch	14:17	And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD
1ch	15:1	And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a
1ch	15:2	Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the
1ch	15:3	And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up
1ch	15:4	And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites: 15:5
1ch	15:11	And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the
1ch	15:13	For because ye did it not at the first, the LORD our God made a
1ch	15:14	So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up
1ch	15:15	And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their
1ch	15:16	And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their
1ch	15:17	So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his
1ch	15:19	So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound
1ch	15:22	And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he instructed
1ch	15:23	And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.
1ch	15:24	And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and
1ch	15:25	So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over
1ch	15:26	And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the
1ch	15:27	And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the
1ch	15:28	Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD
1ch	15:29	And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came
1ch	16:1	So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the
1ch	16:2	And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings
1ch	16:3	And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every
1ch	16:4	And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the
1ch	16:7	Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the
1ch	16:8	Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his
1ch	16:9	Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous
1ch	16:10	Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that
1ch	16:11	Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.
1ch	16:12	Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders,
1ch	16:14	He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.
1ch	16:15	Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he
1ch	16:20	And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom
1ch	16:23	Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day
1ch	16:24	Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among
1ch	16:25	For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is to
1ch	16:26	For all the gods of the people are idols: but the LORD made the
1ch	16:27	Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness are
1ch	16:28	Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the
1ch	16:29	Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an
1ch	16:30	Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable,
1ch	16:31	Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men
1ch	16:32	Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields
1ch	16:33	Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the
1ch	16:34	O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good; for his mercy
1ch	16:35	And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us
1ch	16:36	Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the
1ch	16:37	So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD
1ch	16:43	And all the people departed every man to his house: and David
1ch	17:1	Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said
1ch	17:2	Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for
1ch	17:3	And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to
1ch	17:6	Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any
1ch	17:9	Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant
1ch	17:11	And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou
1ch	17:12	He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for
1ch	17:13	I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not
1ch	17:15	According to all these words, and according to all this vision,
1ch	17:16	And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who
1ch	17:18	What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant?
1ch	17:19	O LORD, for thy servant’s sake, and according to thine own
1ch	17:20	O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside
1ch	17:21	And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom
1ch	17:23	Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken
1ch	17:24	Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for
1ch	17:25	For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build
1ch	17:26	And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness
1ch	18:1	Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines,
1ch	18:2	And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David’s servants, and
1ch	18:3	And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went
1ch	18:4	And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand
1ch	18:5	And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of
1ch	18:6	Then David put garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became
1ch	18:7	And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of
1ch	18:8	Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer,
1ch	18:9	Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the
1ch	18:11	Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver
1ch	18:12	Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the
1ch	18:13	And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became
1ch	18:14	So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and
1ch	18:15	And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat
1ch	18:16	And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar,
1ch	19:1	Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the
1ch	19:2	And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of
1ch	19:3	But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest
1ch	19:5	Then there went certain, and told David how the men were served.
1ch	19:6	And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves
1ch	19:7	So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of
1ch	19:8	And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the
1ch	19:9	And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array
1ch	19:10	Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and
1ch	19:11	And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai
1ch	19:12	And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou
1ch	19:13	Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for
1ch	19:14	So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the
1ch	19:15	And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
1ch	19:16	And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before
1ch	19:17	And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed
1ch	19:18	But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the
1ch	19:19	And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the
1ch	20:1	And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time
1ch	20:2	And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and
1ch	20:3	And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with
1ch	20:4	And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer
1ch	20:5	And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son
1ch	20:6	And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great
1ch	20:7	But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David’s
1ch	20:8	These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand
1ch	21:1	And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number
1ch	21:2	And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go,
1ch	21:3	And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so
1ch	21:5	And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And
1ch	21:6	But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king’s
1ch	21:7	And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote
1ch	21:8	And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have
1ch	21:9	And the LORD spake unto Gad, David’s seer, saying, 21:10 Go and
1ch	21:11	So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD,
1ch	21:13	And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now
1ch	21:14	So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of
1ch	21:15	And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he
1ch	21:16	And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD
1ch	21:17	And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people
1ch	21:18	Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that
1ch	21:19	And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the
1ch	21:20	And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with
1ch	21:21	And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went
1ch	21:22	Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this
1ch	21:23	And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the
1ch	21:24	And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for
1ch	21:25	So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold
1ch	21:26	And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt
1ch	21:27	And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again
1ch	21:28	At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in
1ch	21:29	For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the
1ch	21:30	But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was
1ch	22:1	Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is
1ch	22:2	And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in
1ch	22:3	And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors
1ch	22:5	And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house
1ch	22:6	Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an
1ch	22:7	And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind
1ch	22:9	Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest;
1ch	22:10	He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and
1ch	22:11	Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build
1ch	22:12	Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee
1ch	22:13	Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the
1ch	22:14	Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the
1ch	22:15	Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and
1ch	22:16	Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is
1ch	22:17	David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon
1ch	22:19	Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God;
1ch	23:1	So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son
1ch	23:2	And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the
1ch	23:3	Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and
1ch	23:4	Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work
1ch	23:5	Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised
1ch	23:6	And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi,

1ch	23:24	These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers;

1ch	27:12	The ninth captain for the ninth month was Abiezer the
1ch	27:13	The tenth captain for the tenth month was Maharai the

1ch	27:16	Furthermore over the tribes of Israel: the ruler of the
1ch	27:23	But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and
1ch	27:24	Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not,
1ch	27:25	And over the king’s treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and
1ch	27:32	Also Jonathan David’s uncle was a counsellor, a wise man, and a
1ch	28:1	And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the
1ch	28:2	Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my
1ch	28:4	Howbeit the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of
1ch	28:6	And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and
1ch	28:7	Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant
1ch	28:8	Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the
1ch	28:9	And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and
1ch	28:10	Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house
1ch	28:11	Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and
1ch	28:14	He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all
1ch	28:15	Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their
1ch	28:16	And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread, for
1ch	28:19	All this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing by
1ch	28:20	And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good
1ch	28:21	And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even
1ch	29:1	Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation,
1ch	29:2	Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the
1ch	29:3	Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God,
1ch	29:4	Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and
1ch	29:8	And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the
1ch	29:9	Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly,
1ch	29:10	Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation:
1ch	29:11	Thine, O LORD is the greatness, and the power, and the glory,
1ch	29:12	Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all;
1ch	29:13	Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious
1ch	29:14	But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to
1ch	29:15	For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all
1ch	29:16	O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build
1ch	29:17	I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast
1ch	29:18	O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep
1ch	29:20	And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your
1ch	29:21	And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt
1ch	29:23	Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of
1ch	29:24	And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons
1ch	29:25	And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all
1ch	29:26	Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
1ch	29:27	And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven
1ch	29:28	And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour:
1ch	29:29	Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are
2ch	1:1	And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and
2ch	1:2	Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands
2ch	1:3	So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high
2ch	1:4	But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to the
2ch	1:5	Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son
2ch	1:6	And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the LORD,
2ch	1:7	In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask
2ch	1:8	And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David
2ch	1:9	Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be
2ch	1:10	Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in
2ch	1:13	Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at
2ch	1:14	And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand
2ch	1:15	And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as
2ch	1:16	And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the
2ch	1:17	And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for
2ch	2:1	And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the LORD,
2ch	2:2	And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear
2ch	2:3	And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst
2ch	2:4	Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to
2ch	2:5	And the house which I build is great: for great is our God above
2ch	2:6	But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and
2ch	2:8	Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of
2ch	2:10	And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut
2ch	2:11	Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to
2ch	2:12	Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that made
2ch	2:13	And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of
2ch	2:15	Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine,
2ch	2:17	And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of
2ch	2:18	And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of
2ch	3:1	Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in
2ch	3:2	And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in
2ch	3:3	Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the
2ch	3:4	And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length of it
2ch	3:5	And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid
2ch	3:6	And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and
2ch	3:7	He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls
2ch	3:8	And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was according
2ch	3:9	And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he
2ch	3:10	And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work,
2ch	3:11	And the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long: one wing
2ch	3:12	And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the
2ch	3:13	The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty
2ch	3:14	And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine
2ch	3:15	Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five
2ch	3:16	And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads
2ch	3:17	And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right
2ch	4:1	Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length
2ch	4:2	Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round
2ch	4:3	And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it
2ch	4:4	It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and
2ch	4:5	And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it
2ch	4:6	He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five
2ch	4:7	And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and
2ch	4:8	He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on
2ch	4:9	Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court,
2ch	4:10	And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over
2ch	4:11	And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And
2ch	4:14	He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases; 4:15 One
2ch	4:16	The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their
2ch	4:17	In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground
2ch	4:18	Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the
2ch	4:19	And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God,
2ch	4:20	Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn
2ch	5:1	Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was
2ch	5:2	Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of
2ch	5:3	Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king
2ch	5:4	And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the
2ch	5:5	And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the
2ch	5:6	Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were
2ch	5:7	And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD
2ch	5:9	And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the
2ch	5:10	There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put
2ch	5:11	And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy
2ch	6:1	Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the
2ch	6:2	But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place for
2ch	6:3	And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation
2ch	6:4	And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who hath with his
2ch	6:7	Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for
2ch	6:8	But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine
2ch	6:10	The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken:
2ch	6:11	And in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of the
2ch	6:12	And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all
2ch	6:14	And said, O LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee in the
2ch	6:16	Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David
2ch	6:17	Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which
2ch	6:18	But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold,
2ch	6:21	Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and of
2ch	6:22	If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him
2ch	6:23	Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by
2ch	6:24	And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy,
2ch	6:25	Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy
2ch	6:26	When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they
2ch	6:28	If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there
2ch	6:32	Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people
2ch	6:34	If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that
2ch	6:36	If they sin against thee, (for there is no man which sinneth
2ch	6:40	Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let
2ch	6:41	Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting place, thou,
2ch	6:42	O LORD God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember
2ch	7:1	Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down
2ch	7:2	And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD,
2ch	7:3	And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down,
2ch	7:4	Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the
2ch	7:5	And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand
2ch	7:6	And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with
2ch	7:7	Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before
2ch	7:8	Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all
2ch	7:9	And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept
2ch	7:10	And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent
2ch	7:11	Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king’s
2ch	7:12	And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I
2ch	7:13	If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the
2ch	7:14	If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble
2ch	7:15	Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer
2ch	7:16	For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may
2ch	7:17	And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father
2ch	7:19	But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments,
2ch	7:21	And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every
2ch	8:1	And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon
2ch	8:3	And Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it.
2ch	8:4	And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities,
2ch	8:5	Also he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether,
2ch	8:7	As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the
2ch	8:9	But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his
2ch	8:10	And these were the chief of king Solomon’s officers, even two
2ch	8:11	And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of
2ch	8:12	Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the altar
2ch	8:14	And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the
2ch	8:15	And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the
2ch	8:16	Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the
2ch	8:17	Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in
2ch	8:18	And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and
2ch	9:1	And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came
2ch	9:2	And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid
2ch	9:3	And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and
2ch	9:5	And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard in
2ch	9:7	Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, which stand
2ch	9:8	Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee
2ch	9:9	And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and
2ch	9:10	And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon,
2ch	9:11	And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the
2ch	9:12	And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire,
2ch	9:13	Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six
2ch	9:15	And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six
2ch	9:16	And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold: three hundred
2ch	9:17	Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it
2ch	9:18	And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold,
2ch	9:20	And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold, and
2ch	9:21	For the king’s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram:
2ch	9:22	And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and
2ch	9:23	And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to
2ch	9:24	And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and
2ch	9:25	And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and
2ch	9:26	And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the
2ch	9:27	And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees
2ch	9:28	And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all
2ch	9:29	Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not
2ch	9:31	And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city
2ch	10:1	And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel come
2ch	10:2	And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was in
2ch	10:3	And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and
2ch	10:5	And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And
2ch	10:6	And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood
2ch	10:8	But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took
2ch	10:9	And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return
2ch	10:11	For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more
2ch	10:12	So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third
2ch	10:13	And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook
2ch	10:15	So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of
2ch	10:16	And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto
2ch	10:17	But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of
2ch	10:18	Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and
2ch	10:19	And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
2ch	11:1	And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house
2ch	11:2	But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
2ch	11:3	Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all
2ch	11:5	And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in
2ch	11:6	He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa, 11:7 And Bethzur,
2ch	11:11	And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and
2ch	11:12	And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made
2ch	11:13	And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted
2ch	11:14	For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and
2ch	11:16	And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their
2ch	11:17	So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the
2ch	11:18	And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son
2ch	11:19	Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.
2ch	11:20	And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which
2ch	11:21	And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his
2ch	11:23	And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children
2ch	12:1	And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom,
2ch	12:2	And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam
2ch	12:4	And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came
2ch	12:5	Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of
2ch	12:6	Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves;
2ch	12:7	And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of
2ch	12:8	Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my
2ch	12:9	So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away
2ch	12:10	Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and
2ch	12:11	And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard
2ch	12:12	And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from
2ch	12:13	So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned:
2ch	12:14	And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the
2ch	12:15	Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written
2ch	12:16	And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city
2ch	13:1	Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign
2ch	13:2	He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was
2ch	13:3	And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of
2ch	13:4	And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount
2ch	13:7	And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial,
2ch	13:8	And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand
2ch	13:9	Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron,
2ch	13:10	But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken
2ch	13:12	And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his
2ch	13:13	But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so
2ch	13:14	And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and
2ch	13:15	Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah
2ch	13:16	And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered
2ch	13:17	And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so
2ch	13:18	Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and
2ch	13:19	And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him,
2ch	13:20	Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of
2ch	13:21	But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat
2ch	13:22	And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his
2ch	14:1	So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city
2ch	14:2	And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD
2ch	14:5	Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places
2ch	14:6	And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and
2ch	14:7	Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make
2ch	14:8	And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of
2ch	14:9	And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host
2ch	14:10	Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array
2ch	14:11	And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is
2ch	14:12	So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah;
2ch	14:13	And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto
2ch	14:14	And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of
2ch	14:15	They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and
2ch	15:1	And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded: 15:2 And
2ch	15:3	Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and
2ch	15:4	But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of
2ch	15:5	And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor
2ch	15:6	And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did
2ch	15:7	Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your
2ch	15:8	And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the
2ch	15:9	And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with
2ch	15:10	So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third
2ch	15:11	And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil which
2ch	15:12	And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their
2ch	15:14	And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with
2ch	15:15	And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all
2ch	15:16	And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he
2ch	15:17	But the high places were not taken away out of Israel:
2ch	15:18	And he brought into the house of God the things that his father
2ch	15:19	And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of
2ch	16:1	In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of
2ch	16:2	Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the
2ch	16:4	And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of
2ch	16:5	And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off
2ch	16:6	Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the
2ch	16:7	And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and
2ch	16:8	Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very
2ch	16:9	For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole
2ch	16:10	Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house;
2ch	16:11	And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are
2ch	16:12	And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased
2ch	16:13	And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth
2ch	16:14	And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for
2ch	17:1	And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened
2ch	17:2	And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set
2ch	17:3	And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first
2ch	17:5	Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all
2ch	17:6	And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he
2ch	17:7	Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, even
2ch	17:8	And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and
2ch	17:9	And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the LORD
2ch	17:10	And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands
2ch	17:11	Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and
2ch	17:12	And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah
2ch	17:13	And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of
2ch	17:14	And these are the numbers of them according to the house of
2ch	17:15	And next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two
2ch	17:16	And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly
2ch	17:17	And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him
2ch	17:18	And next him was Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and
2ch	17:19	These waited on the king, beside those whom the king put in the
2ch	18:1	Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined
2ch	18:2	And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab
2ch	18:3	And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt
2ch	18:4	And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray
2ch	18:5	Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four
2ch	18:6	But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD
2ch	18:8	And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and said,
2ch	18:9	And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either
2ch	18:10	And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron,
2ch	18:11	And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to
2ch	18:12	And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him,
2ch	18:13	And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, even what my God saith,
2ch	18:14	And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him,
2ch	18:15	And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee
2ch	18:16	Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains,
2ch	18:17	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee
2ch	18:19	And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he
2ch	18:20	Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and
2ch	18:22	Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the
2ch	18:23	Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah
2ch	18:25	Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him
2ch	18:26	And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and
2ch	18:27	And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath
2ch	18:28	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up
2ch	18:29	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise
2ch	18:30	Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots
2ch	18:31	And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw
2ch	18:32	For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots
2ch	18:33	And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of
2ch	18:34	And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel
2ch	19:1	And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace
2ch	19:2	And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and
2ch	19:3	Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou
2ch	19:4	And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through
2ch	19:5	And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of
2ch	19:7	Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and
2ch	19:8	Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and of
2ch	19:9	And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the
2ch	19:10	And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that
2ch	19:11	And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters
2ch	20:1	It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab, and
2ch	20:2	Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh
2ch	20:3	And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and
2ch	20:4	And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the LORD:
2ch	20:5	And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem,
2ch	20:10	And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir,
2ch	20:11	Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy
2ch	20:12	O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might
2ch	20:13	And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones,
2ch	20:14	Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the
2ch	20:16	To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the
2ch	20:17	Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand
2ch	20:18	And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground: and
2ch	20:19	And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the
2ch	20:20	And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the
2ch	20:21	And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers
2ch	20:22	And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set
2ch	20:23	For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the
2ch	20:24	And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness,
2ch	20:25	And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil
2ch	20:26	And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of
2ch	20:27	Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and
2ch	20:28	And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and
2ch	20:29	And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries,
2ch	20:30	So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest
2ch	20:31	And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years
2ch	20:32	And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not
2ch	20:33	Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the
2ch	20:34	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold,
2ch	20:35	And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with
2ch	20:37	Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against
2ch	21:1	Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
2ch	21:2	And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel,
2ch	21:3	And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold,
2ch	21:4	Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he
2ch	21:5	Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and
2ch	21:6	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the
2ch	21:7	Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of
2ch	21:8	In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of
2ch	21:9	Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots
2ch	21:10	So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this
2ch	21:11	Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah and
2ch	21:12	And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying,
2ch	21:16	Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the
2ch	21:18	And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an
2ch	21:19	And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of
2ch	21:20	Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he
2ch	22:1	And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son
2ch	22:2	Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and
2ch	22:3	He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother
2ch	22:4	Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of
2ch	22:5	He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son
2ch	22:6	And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds
2ch	22:7	And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for
2ch	22:8	And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon
2ch	22:9	And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in
2ch	22:10	But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was
2ch	22:11	But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son
2ch	22:12	And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and
2ch	23:1	And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took
2ch	23:2	And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all
2ch	23:3	And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the
2ch	23:4	This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering
2ch	23:6	But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests,
2ch	23:7	And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man
2ch	23:8	So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that
2ch	23:9	Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of
2ch	23:10	And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his
2ch	23:11	Then they brought out the king’s son, and put upon him the
2ch	23:12	Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and
2ch	23:13	And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the
2ch	23:14	Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds
2ch	23:15	So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering
2ch	23:16	And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the
2ch	23:17	Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it
2ch	23:18	Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by
2ch	23:19	And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD,
2ch	23:20	And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the
2ch	23:21	And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet,
2ch	24:1	Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
2ch	24:2	And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all
2ch	24:3	And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and
2ch	24:4	And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair
2ch	24:5	And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to
2ch	24:6	And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him,
2ch	24:8	And at the king’s commandment they made a chest, and set it
2ch	24:9	And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to
2ch	24:10	And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in,
2ch	24:11	Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought
2ch	24:12	And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the
2ch	24:13	So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and
2ch	24:14	And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the
2ch	24:15	But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an
2ch	24:16	And they buried him in the city of David among the kings,
2ch	24:17	Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and
2ch	24:18	And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and
2ch	24:19	Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD;
2ch	24:20	And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada
2ch	24:21	And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at
2ch	24:22	Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada
2ch	24:23	And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of
2ch	24:24	For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men,
2ch	24:25	And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in
2ch	24:26	And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of
2ch	24:27	Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid
2ch	25:1	Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and
2ch	25:2	And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but not
2ch	25:3	Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him,
2ch	25:4	But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the
2ch	25:5	Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains
2ch	25:6	He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of
2ch	25:7	But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the
2ch	25:8	But if thou wilt go, do it; be strong for the battle: God shall
2ch	25:9	And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the
2ch	25:10	Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to
2ch	25:11	And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and
2ch	25:12	And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah
2ch	25:13	But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they
2ch	25:14	Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the
2ch	25:15	Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and
2ch	25:17	Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the
2ch	25:18	And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying,
2ch	25:19	Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart
2ch	25:21	So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in
2ch	25:22	And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled
2ch	25:23	And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son
2ch	25:24	And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels
2ch	25:25	And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death
2ch	25:26	Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are
2ch	25:28	And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his
2ch	26:1	Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years
2ch	26:2	He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king
2ch	26:3	Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he
2ch	26:4	And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
2ch	26:5	And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding
2ch	26:6	And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake
2ch	26:7	And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the
2ch	26:8	And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread
2ch	26:9	Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and
2ch	26:10	Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for
2ch	26:11	Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to
2ch	26:12	The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men
2ch	26:13	And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and
2ch	26:14	And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields,
2ch	26:15	And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be
2ch	26:16	But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his
2ch	26:17	And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore
2ch	26:19	Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn
2ch	26:20	And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon
2ch	26:21	And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and
2ch	26:22	Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah
2ch	26:23	So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his
2ch	27:1	Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and
2ch	27:2	And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
2ch	27:3	He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall
2ch	27:4	Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the
2ch	27:5	He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed
2ch	27:6	So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the
2ch	27:7	Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his
2ch	27:8	He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and
2ch	27:9	And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
2ch	28:1	Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
2ch	28:3	Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and
2ch	28:4	He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on
2ch	28:5	Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the
2ch	28:6	For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty
2ch	28:7	And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king’s
2ch	28:8	And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren
2ch	28:9	But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and he
2ch	28:10	And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and
2ch	28:12	Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah
2ch	28:14	So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the
2ch	28:15	And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the
2ch	28:16	At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to
2ch	28:17	For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried
2ch	28:18	The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country,
2ch	28:19	For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel;
2ch	28:20	And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and
2ch	28:21	For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and
2ch	28:22	And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against
2ch	28:23	For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him:
2ch	28:24	And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and
2ch	28:25	And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn
2ch	28:26	Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last,
2ch	28:27	And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
2ch	29:1	Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old,
2ch	29:2	And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
2ch	29:3	He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the
2ch	29:4	And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them
2ch	29:6	For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in
2ch	29:7	Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the
2ch	29:8	Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and
2ch	29:9	For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and
2ch	29:10	Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of
2ch	29:11	My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to
2ch	29:12	Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the
2ch	29:13	And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons
2ch	29:15	And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and
2ch	29:16	And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the
2ch	29:17	Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify,
2ch	29:18	Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have
2ch	29:19	Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast
2ch	29:20	Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of
2ch	29:21	And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven
2ch	29:22	So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood,
2ch	29:23	And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before
2ch	29:24	And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with
2ch	29:25	And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals,
2ch	29:26	And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the
2ch	29:27	And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the
2ch	29:28	And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and
2ch	29:29	And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that
2ch	29:30	Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites
2ch	29:31	Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated
2ch	29:32	And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation
2ch	29:33	And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three
2ch	29:34	But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all
2ch	29:35	And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of
2ch	29:36	And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared
2ch	30:1	And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also
2ch	30:2	For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the
2ch	30:3	For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had
2ch	30:4	And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.
2ch	30:5	So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all
2ch	30:6	So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes
2ch	30:7	And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which
2ch	30:8	Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield
2ch	30:9	For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your
2ch	30:10	So the posts passed from city to city through the country of
2ch	30:11	Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled
2ch	30:12	Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do
2ch	30:13	And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast
2ch	30:14	And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem,
2ch	30:15	Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the
2ch	30:16	And they stood in their place after their manner, according to
2ch	30:17	For there were many in the congregation that were not
2ch	30:18	For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and
2ch	30:20	And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.
2ch	30:21	And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept
2ch	30:22	And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught
2ch	30:23	And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days:
2ch	30:24	For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a
2ch	30:25	And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the
2ch	30:26	So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of
2ch	30:27	Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and
2ch	31:1	Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went
2ch	31:2	And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites
2ch	31:3	He appointed also the king’s portion of his substance for the
2ch	31:4	Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give
2ch	31:5	And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of
2ch	31:6	And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in
2ch	31:7	In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps,
2ch	31:8	And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they
2ch	31:9	Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites
2ch	31:10	And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him,
2ch	31:11	Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the
2ch	31:13	And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth,
2ch	31:14	And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the
2ch	31:15	And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah,
2ch	31:20	And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that
2ch	31:21	And in every work that he began in the service of the house of
2ch	32:1	After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib
2ch	32:2	And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was
2ch	32:4	So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the
2ch	32:5	Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was
2ch	32:6	And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them
2ch	32:9	After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to
2ch	32:11	Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by
2ch	32:17	He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and to
2ch	32:18	Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ speech unto the
2ch	32:19	And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods
2ch	32:20	And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the
2ch	32:21	And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of
2ch	32:22	Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
2ch	32:23	And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents
2ch	32:24	In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto
2ch	32:25	But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done
2ch	32:26	Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his
2ch	32:27	And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made
2ch	32:29	Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and
2ch	32:30	This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon,
2ch	32:31	Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of
2ch	32:32	Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold,
2ch	32:33	And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
2ch	33:1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he
2ch	33:3	For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had
2ch	33:4	Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD
2ch	33:5	And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts
2ch	33:6	And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley
2ch	33:7	And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the
2ch	33:9	So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err,
2ch	33:10	And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they
2ch	33:11	Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of
2ch	33:12	And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and
2ch	33:14	Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the
2ch	33:15	And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house
2ch	33:16	And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon
2ch	33:17	Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places,
2ch	33:18	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his
2ch	33:19	His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his
2ch	33:20	So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his
2ch	33:21	Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and
2ch	33:22	But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did
2ch	33:24	And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own
2ch	33:25	But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired
2ch	34:1	Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
2ch	34:2	And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and
2ch	34:3	For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he
2ch	34:4	And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the
2ch	34:5	And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and
2ch	34:6	And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon,
2ch	34:7	And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had
2ch	34:8	Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the
2ch	34:9	And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the
2ch	34:10	And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the
2ch	34:11	Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn
2ch	34:12	And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them
2ch	34:13	Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers
2ch	34:14	And when they brought out the money that was brought into the
2ch	34:15	And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have
2ch	34:16	And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king
2ch	34:17	And they have gathered together the money that was found in the
2ch	34:18	Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the
2ch	34:19	And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the
2ch	34:20	And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan,
2ch	34:22	And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to
2ch	34:23	And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell
2ch	34:26	And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the
2ch	34:28	Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be
2ch	34:29	Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah
2ch	34:30	And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men
2ch	34:31	And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the
2ch	34:32	And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to
2ch	34:33	And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the
2ch	35:1	Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem: and
2ch	35:2	And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to
2ch	35:5	And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the
2ch	35:6	So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your
2ch	35:7	And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all
2ch	35:8	And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests,
2ch	35:9	Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and
2ch	35:10	So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their
2ch	35:11	And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the
2ch	35:12	And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give
2ch	35:13	And they roasted the passover with fire according to the
2ch	35:14	And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the
2ch	35:15	And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according
2ch	35:16	So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to
2ch	35:17	And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover
2ch	35:18	And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the
2ch	35:19	In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover
2ch	35:20	After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king
2ch	35:21	But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with
2ch	35:22	Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but
2ch	35:23	And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his
2ch	35:24	His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him
2ch	35:25	And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and
2ch	35:26	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according
2ch	36:1	Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and

2ch	36:5	Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign,
2ch	36:6	Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him
2ch	36:7	Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the

2ch	36:11	Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign,
2ch	36:12	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God,
2ch	36:13	And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made
2ch	36:14	Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people,
2ch	36:15	And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his

ezr	5:12	But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto
ezr	5:13	But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king
ezr	5:14	And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God,
ezr	5:16	Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the

ezr	6:15	And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar,
ezr	6:16	And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the
ezr	6:17	And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred
ezr	6:18	And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in
ezr	6:19	And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the

ezr	6:21	And the children of Israel, which were come again out of

ezr	7:7	And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the
ezr	7:8	And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the
ezr	7:9	For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from
ezr	7:10	For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and
ezr	7:11	Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave
ezr	7:12	Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the
ezr	7:13	I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and of
ezr	7:14	Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven
ezr	7:18	And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to
ezr	7:19	The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house
ezr	7:20	And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God,
ezr	7:21	And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the
ezr	7:23	Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be
ezr	7:25	And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine
ezr	7:26	And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the
ezr	7:27	Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers, which hath put such a
ezr	8:1	These are now the chief of their fathers, and this is the
ezr	8:2	Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar; Daniel:
ezr	8:3	Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah: and
ezr	8:4	Of the sons of Pahathmoab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with
ezr	8:5	Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him three
ezr	8:6	Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him
ezr	8:7	And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with
ezr	8:8	And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael, and
ezr	8:9	Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two
ezr	8:10	And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with him
ezr	8:11	And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with
ezr	8:12	And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with
ezr	8:13	And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these,
ezr	8:14	Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them
ezr	8:15	And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava;
ezr	8:16	Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for
ezr	8:17	And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place
ezr	8:18	And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of
ezr	8:21	Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we
ezr	8:22	For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and
ezr	8:23	So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated
ezr	8:24	Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah,
ezr	8:28	And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the LORD; the vessels are
ezr	8:29	Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief of
ezr	8:30	So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and
ezr	8:31	Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of
ezr	8:32	And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.
ezr	8:33	Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels
ezr	8:35	Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were
ezr	8:36	And they delivered the king’s commissions unto the king’s
ezr	9:1	Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying,
ezr	9:2	For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for
ezr	9:3	And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and
ezr	9:4	Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words
ezr	9:5	And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and
ezr	9:7	Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass
ezr	9:8	And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the LORD
ezr	9:9	For we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our
ezr	9:10	And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have
ezr	9:12	Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither
ezr	9:13	And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for
ezr	10:1	Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and
ezr	10:2	And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam,
ezr	10:3	Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all
ezr	10:4	Arise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be with
ezr	10:5	Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all
ezr	10:6	Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the
ezr	10:7	And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto
ezr	10:9	Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves
ezr	10:10	And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have
ezr	10:11	Now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers,
ezr	10:12	Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice,
ezr	10:13	But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we
ezr	10:14	Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all
ezr	10:15	Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah
ezr	10:16	And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest,
ezr	10:17	And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange

neh	1:3	And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity
neh	1:4	And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and
neh	1:7	We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the
neh	1:8	Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy
neh	1:10	Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast
neh	1:11	O LORD, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the
neh	2:1	And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of
neh	2:2	Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad,
neh	2:5	And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy
neh	2:6	And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For
neh	2:7	Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters
neh	2:9	Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the
neh	2:10	When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the
neh	2:11	So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.
neh	2:12	And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither
neh	2:13	And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before
neh	2:14	Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king’s
neh	2:15	Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall,
neh	2:16	And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither
neh	2:17	Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how
neh	2:18	Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as
neh	2:19	But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the
neh	3:1	Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the
neh	3:2	And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them
neh	3:3	But the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build, who also laid

neh	3:24	After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another piece, from
neh	3:25	Palal the son of Uzai, over against the turning of the wall, and
neh	3:26	Moreover the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel, unto the place over
neh	3:27	After them the Tekoites repaired another piece, over against the

neh	3:32	And between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate
neh	4:1	But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded the
neh	4:2	And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and
neh	4:4	Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon
neh	4:6	So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto
neh	4:7	But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the
neh	4:9	Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch
neh	4:10	And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is
neh	4:11	And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till
neh	4:12	And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came,
neh	4:13	Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the
neh	4:14	And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the
neh	4:15	And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known
neh	4:16	And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my
neh	4:17	They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with
neh	4:18	For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and
neh	4:19	And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of
neh	4:20	In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort
neh	4:21	So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from
neh	4:22	Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one
neh	4:23	So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of
neh	5:1	And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against
neh	5:2	For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are
neh	5:3	Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands,
neh	5:4	There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king’s
neh	5:5	Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as
neh	5:6	And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.
neh	5:7	Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the
neh	5:8	And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our
neh	5:9	Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in
neh	5:11	Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their
neh	5:12	Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of
neh	5:13	Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from
neh	5:14	Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor
neh	5:15	But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable
neh	5:16	Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we
neh	5:17	Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews
neh	5:18	Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six
neh	5:19	Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have
neh	6:1	Now it came to pass when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the
neh	6:3	And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work,
neh	6:5	Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth
neh	6:7	And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at
neh	6:8	Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as
neh	6:9	For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened
neh	6:10	Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah
neh	6:11	And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that,
neh	6:12	And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he
neh	6:13	Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and
neh	6:14	My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these
neh	6:15	So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month
neh	6:16	And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and
neh	6:17	Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto
neh	6:18	For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the
neh	6:19	Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words
neh	7:1	Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the
neh	7:2	That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the
neh	7:3	And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened
neh	7:4	Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein,
neh	7:5	And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and
neh	7:9	The children of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy and two.

neh	7:61	And these were they which went up also from Telmelah, Telharesha,
neh	7:62	The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of
neh	7:63	And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz,
neh	7:64	These sought their register among those that were reckoned by
neh	7:65	And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the
neh	7:66	The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three
neh	7:68	Their horses, seven hundred thirty and six: their mules, two
neh	7:70	And some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work. The
neh	7:71	And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the
neh	7:72	And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand
neh	7:73	So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the
neh	8:1	And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into
neh	8:2	And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both
neh	8:3	And he read therein before the street that was before the water
neh	8:4	And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had
neh	8:5	And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he
neh	8:7	Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai,
neh	8:8	So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave
neh	8:9	And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the
neh	8:10	Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the
neh	8:11	So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace,
neh	8:12	And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to
neh	8:13	And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the
neh	8:14	And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by
neh	8:16	So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves
neh	8:17	And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the
neh	8:18	Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in
neh	9:1	Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of
neh	9:2	And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers,
neh	9:3	And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law
neh	9:4	Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani,
neh	9:5	Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah,
neh	9:6	Thou, even thou, art LORD alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven
neh	9:7	Thou art the LORD the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest
neh	9:11	And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went
neh	9:12	Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in
neh	9:13	Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them
neh	9:16	But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks,
neh	9:18	Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy
neh	9:20	Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and
neh	9:21	Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so
neh	9:22	Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide
neh	9:23	Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and
neh	9:24	So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou
neh	9:25	And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses
neh	9:26	Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee,
neh	9:27	Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies,
neh	9:28	But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee:
neh	9:30	Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against
neh	9:31	Nevertheless for thy great mercies’ sake thou didst not utterly
neh	9:32	Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible
neh	9:33	Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou
neh	9:35	For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great
neh	9:36	Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou
neh	9:38	And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it;
neh	10:1	Now those that sealed were, Nehemiah, the Tirshatha, the son of

neh	10:28	And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the
neh	10:32	Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with
neh	10:33	For the shewbread, and for the continual meat offering, and for
neh	10:34	And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the
neh	10:35	And to bring the firstfruits of our ground, and the firstfruits
neh	10:36	Also the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is
neh	10:38	And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites, when
neh	10:39	For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring
neh	11:1	And the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem: the rest of the
neh	11:2	And the people blessed all the men, that willingly offered
neh	11:3	Now these are the chief of the province that dwelt in Jerusalem:
neh	11:4	And at Jerusalem dwelt certain of the children of Judah, and of
neh	11:6	All the sons of Perez that dwelt at Jerusalem were four hundred
neh	11:7	And these are the sons of Benjamin; Sallu the son of Meshullam,
neh	11:8	And after him Gabbai, Sallai, nine hundred twenty and eight.

neh	11:13	And his brethren, chief of the fathers, two hundred forty and
neh	11:15	Also of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hashub, the son of
neh	11:17	And Mattaniah the son of Micha, the son of Zabdi, the son of
neh	11:18	All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred fourscore and
neh	11:19	Moreover the porters, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren that
neh	11:20	And the residue of Israel, of the priests, and the Levites, were
neh	11:21	But the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel: and Ziha and Gispa were over
neh	11:22	The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son
neh	11:23	For it was the king’s commandment concerning them, that a
neh	11:24	And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabeel, of the children of Zerah
neh	11:25	And for the villages, with their fields, some of the children of
neh	11:28	And at Ziklag, and at Mekonah, and in the villages thereof,
neh	11:29	And at Enrimmon, and at Zareah, and at Jarmuth, 11:30 Zanoah,
neh	11:31	The children also of Benjamin from Geba dwelt at Michmash, and
neh	11:32	And at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah, 11:33 Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,
neh	11:34	Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat, 11:35 Lod, and Ono, the valley of
neh	11:36	And of the Levites were divisions in Judah, and in Benjamin.
neh	12:1	Now these are the priests and the Levites that went up with
neh	12:2	Amariah, Malluch, Hattush, 12:3 Shechaniah, Rehum, Meremoth, 12:4
neh	12:8	Moreover the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah,
neh	12:9	Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brethren, were over against them
neh	12:10	And Jeshua begat Joiakim, Joiakim also begat Eliashib, and
neh	12:12	And in the days of Joiakim were priests, the chief of the
neh	12:22	The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and
neh	12:23	The sons of Levi, the chief of the fathers, were written in the
neh	12:24	And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua
neh	12:25	Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub,
neh	12:26	These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of
neh	12:27	And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the
neh	12:28	And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both
neh	12:30	And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and
neh	12:31	Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and
neh	12:36	And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai,
neh	12:37	And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went
neh	12:38	And the other company of them that gave thanks went over against
neh	12:40	So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house
neh	12:43	Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for
neh	12:44	And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the
neh	12:45	And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God,
neh	12:46	For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of
neh	12:47	And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of
neh	13:1	On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the
neh	13:3	Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they
neh	13:4	And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the
neh	13:6	But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and
neh	13:8	And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household
neh	13:9	Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither
neh	13:10	And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been
neh	13:11	Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of
neh	13:12	Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine
neh	13:13	And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest,
neh	13:14	Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good
neh	13:15	In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the
neh	13:16	There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and
neh	13:17	Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them,
neh	13:18	Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this
neh	13:19	And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to
neh	13:20	So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without
neh	13:21	Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye
neh	13:22	And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves,
neh	13:23	In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod,
neh	13:25	And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of
neh	13:26	Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among
neh	13:27	Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to
neh	13:29	Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the
neh	13:30	Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards
est	1:1	Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus
est	1:5	And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all
est	1:7	And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being
est	1:8	And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so
est	1:9	Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal
est	1:10	On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with
est	1:12	But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s commandment by
est	1:13	Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so
est	1:17	For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so
est	1:18	Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto
est	1:19	If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him,
est	1:20	And when the king’s decree which he shall make shall be published
est	1:21	And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did
est	2:1	After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased,
est	2:2	Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, Let there
est	2:5	Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was
est	2:7	And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter:
est	2:8	So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree was
est	2:9	And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and
est	2:10	Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai
est	2:11	And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women’s
est	2:12	Now when every maid’s turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus,
est	2:14	In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the
est	2:15	Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of
est	2:16	So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in
est	2:17	And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained
est	2:18	Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his
est	2:19	And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then
est	2:20	Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai
est	2:21	In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king’s gate, two of the
est	2:22	And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the
est	2:23	And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out;
est	3:1	After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of
est	3:2	And all the king’s servants, that were in the king’s gate, bowed,
est	3:3	Then the king’s servants, which were in the king’s gate, said unto
est	3:5	And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence,
est	3:6	And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had
est	3:7	In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year
est	3:8	And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people
est	3:9	If it please the king, let it be written that they may be
est	3:10	And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman
est	3:11	And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the
est	3:12	Then were the king’s scribes called on the thirteenth day of the
est	3:13	And the letters were sent by posts into all the king’s provinces,
est	3:14	The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every
est	3:15	The posts went out, being hastened by the king’s commandment, and
est	4:1	When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his
est	4:3	And in every province, whithersoever the king’s commandment and
est	4:4	So Esther’s maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then
est	4:5	Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king’s chamberlains,
est	4:6	So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city,
est	4:7	And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of
est	4:8	Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was
est	4:9	And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
est	4:10	Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto
est	4:12	And they told to Mordecai Esther’s words.
est	4:13	Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself
est	4:14	For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall
est	4:15	Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer, 4:16 Go,
est	4:17	So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther
est	5:1	Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal
est	5:2	And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the
est	5:3	Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and
est	5:4	And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king
est	5:5	Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as
est	5:6	And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy
est	5:7	Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is; 5:8
est	5:9	Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but
est	5:10	Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he
est	5:11	And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude
est	5:12	Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in
est	5:13	Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the
est	5:14	Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a
est	6:1	On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring
est	6:2	And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and
est	6:3	And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to
est	6:4	And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into
est	6:5	And the king’s servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in
est	6:6	So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done
est	6:10	Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and
est	6:11	Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai,
est	6:12	And Mordecai came again to the king’s gate. But Haman hasted to
est	6:13	And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing
est	6:14	And while they were yet talking with him, came the king’s
est	7:1	So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.
est	7:2	And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the
est	7:3	Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in
est	7:5	Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen,
est	7:6	And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman.
est	7:7	And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went
est	7:8	Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of
est	7:9	And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king,
est	7:10	So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for
est	8:1	On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the
est	8:2	And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and
est	8:3	And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his
est	8:4	Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther
est	8:8	Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king’s name,
est	8:9	Then were the king’s scribes called at that time in the third
est	8:10	And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus’ name, and sealed it with the
est	8:13	The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every
est	8:14	So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being
est	8:15	And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal
est	8:16	The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour.
est	8:17	And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the
est	9:1	Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the
est	9:3	And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the
est	9:4	For Mordecai was great in the king’s house, and his fame went out
est	9:5	Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the
est	9:6	And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred
est	9:7	And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha, 9:8 And Poratha, and
est	9:11	On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the
est	9:12	And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and
est	9:13	Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the
est	9:14	And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given
est	9:15	For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on
est	9:16	But the other Jews that were in the king’s provinces gathered
est	9:18	But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the
est	9:19	Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled
est	9:20	And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the
est	9:23	And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai
est	9:26	Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur.
est	9:29	Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the
est	9:30	And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty
est	9:32	And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it
est	10:1	And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the
est	10:2	And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the
job	1:1	There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that
job	1:2	And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.
job	1:3	His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand
job	1:4	And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day;
job	1:5	And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about,
job	1:6	Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present
job	1:7	And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan
job	1:8	And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job,
job	1:11	But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he
job	1:12	And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy
job	1:13	And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating
job	1:16	While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The
job	1:17	While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The
job	1:18	While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy
job	1:20	Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and
job	1:22	In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.
job	2:1	Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present
job	2:2	And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan
job	2:3	And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job,
job	2:4	And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all
job	2:5	But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh,
job	2:6	And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but
job	2:7	So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job
job	2:8	And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat
job	2:9	Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine
job	2:10	But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women
job	2:11	Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come
job	2:12	And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not,
job	2:13	So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven
job	3:1	After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.
job	3:2	And Job spake, and said, 3:3 Let the day perish wherein I was
job	3:4	Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above,
job	3:5	Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell
job	3:6	As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be
job	3:7	Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.
job	3:8	Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up
job	3:9	Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for
job	3:11	Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost
job	3:14	With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate
job	3:17	There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at
job	3:18	There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the
job	3:19	The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his
job	3:20	Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto
job	3:24	For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured
job	3:25	For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that
job	3:26	I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet
job	4:1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 4:2 If we assay to
job	4:4	Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast
job	4:5	But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee,
job	4:6	Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the
job	4:9	By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils
job	4:10	The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and
job	4:11	The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion’s
job	4:12	Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a
job	4:13	In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep
job	4:15	Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood
job	4:21	Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die,
job	5:1	Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of
job	5:3	I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his
job	5:4	His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the
job	5:5	Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the
job	5:6	Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth
job	5:8	I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause: 5:9
job	5:12	He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands
job	5:13	He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of
job	5:14	They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the noonday
job	5:15	But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from
job	5:16	So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
job	5:17	Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise
job	5:19	He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall
job	5:20	In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the
job	5:21	Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt
job	5:22	At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be
job	5:23	For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the
job	5:24	And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and
job	5:25	Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine
job	5:26	Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of
job	5:27	Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it
job	6:1	But Job answered and said, 6:2 Oh that my grief were throughly
job	6:4	For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof
job	6:5	Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over
job	6:8	Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the
job	6:11	What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end,
job	6:15	My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream
job	6:18	The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and
job	6:19	The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for
job	6:20	They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither,
job	6:21	For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.
job	6:22	Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your
job	6:25	How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?
job	6:26	Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is
job	6:28	Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto
job	6:29	Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my
job	6:30	Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse
job	7:4	When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone?
job	7:5	My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is
job	7:6	My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and are spent without
job	7:7	O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.
job	7:8	The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes
job	7:9	As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down
job	7:10	He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place
job	7:11	Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the
job	7:12	Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me? 7:13
job	7:16	I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days
job	7:17	What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou
job	8:1	Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 8:2 How long wilt thou
job	8:7	Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly
job	8:8	For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself
job	8:13	So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite’s hope
job	8:15	He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall
job	8:16	He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his
job	8:17	His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of
job	8:18	If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying,
job	8:19	Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall
job	8:20	Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he
job	8:22	They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling
job	9:1	Then Job answered and said, 9:2 I know it is so of a truth: but
job	9:4	He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened
job	9:6	Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof
job	9:7	Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the
job	9:8	Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves
job	9:9	Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of
job	9:10	Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders
job	9:11	Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I
job	9:12	Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto
job	9:14	How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to
job	9:16	If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe
job	9:17	For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds
job	9:18	He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with
job	9:19	If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who
job	9:21	Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would
job	9:22	This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect
job	9:23	If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the
job	9:24	The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the
job	9:26	They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that
job	9:27	If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my
job	9:29	If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain? 9:30 If I wash myself
job	9:32	For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we
job	9:33	Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand
job	9:34	Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify
job	10:1	My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon
job	10:2	I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou
job	10:3	Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou
job	10:8	Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about;
job	10:9	Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and
job	10:12	Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath
job	10:13	And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this
job	10:14	If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from
job	10:15	If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I
job	10:17	Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine
job	10:18	Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh
job	10:20	Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may
job	11:1	Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 11:2 Should not
job	11:5	But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee; 11:6
job	11:7	Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the
job	11:10	If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can
job	11:13	If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward
job	11:15	For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou
job	11:18	And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt
job	11:19	Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea,
job	11:20	But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not
job	12:1	And Job answered and said, 12:2 No doubt but ye are the people,
job	12:3	But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to
job	12:5	He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in
job	12:6	The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are
job	12:7	But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls
job	12:9	Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath
job	12:11	Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat? 12:12
job	12:13	With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and
job	12:14	Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he
job	12:15	Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he
job	12:16	With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver
job	12:17	He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges
job	12:18	He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a
job	12:19	He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.
job	12:20	He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the
job	12:21	He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of
job	12:22	He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to
job	12:23	He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the
job	12:24	He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the
job	12:25	They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to
job	13:1	Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and
job	13:2	What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto
job	13:3	Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with
job	13:4	But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.
job	13:5	O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your
job	13:6	Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.
job	13:7	Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?
job	13:8	Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God? 13:9 Is it
job	13:11	Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall
job	13:13	Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on
job	13:14	Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in
job	13:16	He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come
job	13:17	Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.
job	13:18	Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be
job	13:19	Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue,
job	13:20	Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from
job	13:21	Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me
job	13:22	Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer
job	13:23	How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my
job	13:24	Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?
job	13:25	Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue
job	13:27	Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly
job	13:28	And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth
job	14:1	Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble.
job	14:2	He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as
job	14:3	And doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me
job	14:5	Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with
job	14:7	For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will
job	14:8	Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock
job	14:10	But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost,
job	14:13	O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest
job	14:15	Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire
job	14:16	For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my
job	14:18	And surely the mountains falling cometh to nought, and the rock
job	14:19	The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which
job	14:20	Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou
job	14:21	His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are
job	14:22	But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him
job	15:1	Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, 15:2 Should a wise
job	15:5	For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the
job	15:6	Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips
job	15:7	Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before
job	15:11	Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret
job	15:16	How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh
job	15:20	The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number
job	15:21	A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer
job	15:22	He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is
job	15:23	He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth
job	15:24	Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail
job	15:25	For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth
job	15:26	He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of
job	15:28	And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man
job	15:29	He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue,
job	15:30	He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his
job	15:31	Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall
job	15:32	It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall
job	15:33	He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast
job	15:34	For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire
job	15:35	They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly
job	16:1	Then Job answered and said, 16:2 I have heard many such things:
job	16:3	Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou
job	16:5	But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my
job	16:6	Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear,
job	16:8	And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against
job	16:9	He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me
job	16:10	They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me
job	16:11	God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into
job	16:12	I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken
job	16:13	His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins
job	16:14	He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like
job	16:15	I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the
job	16:16	My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of
job	16:18	O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.
job	16:19	Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on
job	16:20	My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.
job	16:21	O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for
job	17:1	My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready
job	17:2	Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in
job	17:5	He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his
job	17:6	He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was
job	17:7	Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are
job	17:8	Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall
job	17:9	The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean
job	17:10	But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot
job	17:11	My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts
job	17:12	They change the night into day: the light is short because of
job	17:13	If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the
job	17:14	I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou
job	17:15	And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?
job	17:16	They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest
job	18:1	Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 18:2 How long will it
job	18:3	Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your
job	18:5	Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of
job	18:6	The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall
job	18:7	The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own
job	18:8	For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a
job	18:9	The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail
job	18:10	The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in
job	18:11	Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him
job	18:12	His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be
job	18:13	It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of
job	18:14	His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it
job	18:15	It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his:
job	18:16	His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch
job	18:17	His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have
job	18:18	He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of
job	18:19	He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any
job	18:20	They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they
job	18:21	Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the
job	19:1	Then Job answered and said, 19:2 How long will ye vex my soul,
job	19:4	And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with
job	19:5	If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead
job	19:7	Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but
job	19:8	He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set
job	19:9	He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my
job	19:10	He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope
job	19:11	He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me
job	19:12	His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and
job	19:13	He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are
job	19:14	My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten
job	19:15	They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a
job	19:16	I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him
job	19:17	My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the
job	19:18	Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against
job	19:19	All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are
job	19:20	My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped
job	19:21	Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the
job	19:22	Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my
job	19:28	But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the
job	20:1	Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 20:2 Therefore do
job	20:3	I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my
job	20:4	Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,
job	20:5	That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the
job	20:9	The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall
job	20:10	His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall
job	20:11	His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down
job	20:12	Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under
job	20:15	He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again:
job	20:16	He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper’s tongue shall slay
job	20:17	He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and
job	20:18	That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not
job	20:19	Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he
job	20:21	There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man
job	20:22	In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every
job	20:23	When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of
job	20:24	He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall
job	20:25	It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering
job	20:26	All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown
job	20:27	The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise
job	20:28	The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow
job	20:29	This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage
job	21:1	But Job answered and said, 21:2 Hear diligently my speech, and
job	21:3	Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock
job	21:4	As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should
job	21:6	Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my
job	21:7	Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in
job	21:9	Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon
job	21:10	Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and
job	21:11	They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their
job	21:12	They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the
job	21:13	They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the
job	21:14	Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not
job	21:15	What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit
job	21:17	How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh
job	21:18	They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm
job	21:19	God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him,
job	21:20	His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the
job	21:21	For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the
job	21:23	One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.
job	21:24	His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with
job	21:25	And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never
job	21:26	They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover
job	21:27	Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye
job	21:28	For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the
job	21:31	Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him
job	21:33	The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man
job	21:34	How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there
job	22:7	Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast
job	22:8	But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable
job	22:9	Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless
job	22:10	Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth
job	22:12	Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the
job	22:15	Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?
job	22:16	Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown
job	22:19	The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them
job	22:20	Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them
job	22:21	Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good
job	22:22	Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his
job	22:23	If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou
job	22:24	Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as
job	22:25	Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have
job	22:26	For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt
job	22:27	Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and
job	22:28	Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto
job	22:29	When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting
job	22:30	He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered
job	23:1	Then Job answered and said, 23:2 Even to day is my complaint
job	23:3	Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to
job	23:5	I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand
job	23:6	Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would
job	23:7	There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be
job	23:8	Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I
job	23:11	My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not
job	23:12	Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I
job	23:13	But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul
job	23:14	For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many
job	23:15	Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am
job	23:16	For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:
job	23:17	Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he
job	24:1	Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that
job	24:3	They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow’s
job	24:4	They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide
job	24:5	Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work;
job	24:6	They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the
job	24:7	They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no
job	24:8	They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the
job	24:9	They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of
job	24:10	They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away
job	24:12	Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded
job	24:13	They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not
job	24:14	The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy,
job	24:15	The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying,
job	24:16	In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for
job	24:17	For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one
job	24:18	He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth:
job	24:19	Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave
job	24:20	The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him;
job	24:21	He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not
job	24:22	He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no
job	24:23	Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet
job	24:24	They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought
job	24:25	And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my
job	25:3	Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his
job	25:6	How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which is a
job	26:3	How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast
job	26:6	Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.
job	26:7	He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the
job	26:8	He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is
job	26:9	He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud
job	26:10	He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and
job	26:11	The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.
job	26:12	He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he
job	26:13	By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath
job	26:14	Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is
job	27:3	All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my
job	27:5	God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not
job	27:6	My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart
job	27:7	Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me
job	27:8	For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained,
job	27:12	Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus
job	27:14	If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his
job	27:15	Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his
job	27:16	Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the
job	27:18	He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper
job	27:19	The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he
job	27:20	Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away
job	27:21	The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a
job	27:22	For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee
job	27:23	Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his
job	28:1	Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where
job	28:2	Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the
job	28:3	He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection:
job	28:4	The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters
job	28:5	As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned
job	28:6	The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of
job	28:7	There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture’s
job	28:9	He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the
job	28:10	He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every
job	28:11	He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is
job	28:12	But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of
job	28:14	The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not
job	28:15	It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed
job	28:16	It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious
job	28:17	The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it
job	28:18	No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price
job	28:19	The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be
job	28:20	Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of
job	28:22	Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with
job	28:23	God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place
job	28:24	For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the
job	28:26	When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning
job	28:28	And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is
job	29:1	Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 29:2 Oh that I were
job	29:8	The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and
job	29:9	The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their
job	29:10	The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the
job	29:11	When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw
job	29:13	The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I
job	29:14	I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a
job	29:15	I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.
job	29:16	I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I
job	29:17	And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of
job	29:18	Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my
job	29:19	My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night
job	29:20	My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.
job	29:21	Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my
job	29:22	After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon
job	29:23	And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their
job	29:24	If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my
job	29:25	I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the
job	30:1	But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose
job	30:2	Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom
job	30:4	Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their
job	30:5	They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as
job	30:7	Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were
job	30:8	They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were
job	30:9	And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.
job	30:10	They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in
job	30:11	Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also
job	30:12	Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and
job	30:13	They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no
job	30:14	They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the
job	30:15	Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and
job	30:16	And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction
job	30:17	My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews
job	30:18	By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it
job	30:19	He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and
job	30:20	I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou
job	30:21	Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest
job	30:22	Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it,
job	30:23	For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house
job	30:24	Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though
job	30:25	Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul
job	30:27	My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction
job	30:28	I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the
job	30:29	I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.
job	30:30	My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.
job	30:31	My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice
job	31:1	I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a
job	31:7	If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked
job	31:9	If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid
job	31:11	For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be
job	31:12	For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root
job	31:13	If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my
job	31:15	Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one
job	31:20	If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with
job	31:23	For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of
job	31:24	If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou
job	31:29	If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted
job	31:31	If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his
job	31:32	The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors
job	31:33	If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity
job	31:36	Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown
job	31:37	I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince
job	31:38	If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof
job	32:1	So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous
job	32:2	Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the
job	32:3	Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because
job	32:4	Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder
job	32:5	When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these
job	32:6	And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am
job	32:7	I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach
job	32:8	But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty
job	32:9	Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand
job	32:10	Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.
job	32:11	Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons,
job	32:12	Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you
job	32:14	Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I
job	32:15	They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.
job	32:16	When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and
job	32:18	For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.
job	32:19	Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to
job	32:20	I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and
job	32:21	Let me not, I pray you, accept any man’s person, neither let me
job	32:22	For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker
job	33:1	Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all
job	33:2	Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my
job	33:3	My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips
job	33:4	The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty
job	33:5	If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand
job	33:6	Behold, I am according to thy wish in God’s stead: I also am
job	33:7	Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my
job	33:8	Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the
job	33:10	Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his
job	33:12	Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God
job	33:13	Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of
job	33:14	For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.
job	33:15	In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth
job	33:18	He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from
job	33:19	He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude
job	33:21	His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his
job	33:22	Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the
job	33:23	If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a
job	33:25	His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s: he shall return to
job	33:27	He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and
job	33:29	Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man, 33:30 To
job	33:31	Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will
job	33:32	If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to
job	33:33	If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee
job	34:1	Furthermore Elihu answered and said, 34:2 Hear my words, O ye
job	34:3	For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.
job	34:4	Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is
job	34:5	For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my
job	34:6	Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without
job	34:7	What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water? 34:8
job	34:9	For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should
job	34:10	Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it
job	34:11	For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every
job	34:12	Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty
job	34:13	Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed
job	34:16	If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice
job	34:17	Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn
job	34:20	In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at
job	34:21	For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his
job	34:22	There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of
job	34:23	For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should
job	34:24	He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set
job	34:25	Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the
job	34:26	He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
job	34:27	Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of
job	34:29	When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he
job	34:31	Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne
job	34:33	Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it,
job	34:34	Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken
job	34:35	Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without
job	34:36	My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his
job	34:37	For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands
job	35:1	Elihu spake moreover, and said, 35:2 Thinkest thou this to be
job	35:5	Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are
job	35:6	If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy
job	35:9	By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed
job	35:10	But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the
job	35:13	Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty
job	35:14	Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is
job	35:15	But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet
job	36:1	Elihu also proceeded, and said, 36:2 Suffer me a little, and I
job	36:3	I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe
job	36:4	For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in
job	36:5	Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in
job	36:6	He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the
job	36:7	He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings
job	36:8	And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of
job	36:10	He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that
job	36:11	If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in
job	36:12	But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they
job	36:13	But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he
job	36:14	They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.
job	36:15	He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears
job	36:16	Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a
job	36:17	But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and
job	36:18	Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his
job	36:19	Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of
job	36:20	Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.
job	36:21	Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather
job	36:22	Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him? 36:23
job	36:25	Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.
job	36:26	Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the
job	36:27	For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain
job	36:29	Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the
job	36:31	For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.
job	36:32	With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to
job	36:33	The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also
job	37:1	At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.
job	37:2	Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth
job	37:3	He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto
job	37:4	After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his
job	37:5	God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth
job	37:6	For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the
job	37:7	He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his
job	37:8	Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.
job	37:9	Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.
job	37:10	By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the
job	37:11	Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his
job	37:13	He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land,
job	37:14	Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous
job	37:15	Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of
job	37:17	How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the
job	37:20	Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he
job	37:21	And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but
job	37:22	Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible
job	37:23	Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent
job	37:24	Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise
job	38:1	Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 38:2
job	38:4	Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?
job	38:5	Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath
job	38:8	Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it
job	38:15	And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm
job	38:16	Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou
job	38:18	Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou
job	38:19	Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness,
job	38:31	Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the
job	39:1	Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring
job	39:4	Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they
job	39:5	Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands
job	39:7	He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the
job	39:8	The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after
job	39:9	Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?
job	39:10	Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will
job	39:16	She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not
job	39:18	What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse
job	39:19	Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck
job	39:21	He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth
job	39:22	He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he
job	39:23	The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the
job	39:24	He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither
job	39:25	He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle
job	39:26	Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward
job	39:29	From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.
job	39:30	Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are,
job	40:1	Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said, 40:2 Shall he that
job	40:3	Then Job answered the LORD, and said, 40:4 Behold, I am vile;
job	40:5	Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will
job	40:6	Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
job	40:7	Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and
job	40:8	Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that
job	40:11	Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is
job	40:12	Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread
job	40:13	Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret.
job	40:14	Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can
job	40:15	Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as
job	40:16	Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the
job	40:17	He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are
job	40:18	His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars
job	40:19	He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make
job	40:20	Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts
job	40:21	He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and
job	40:22	The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the
job	40:23	Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth
job	40:24	He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.
job	41:1	Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a
job	41:9	Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down
job	41:12	I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely
job	41:13	Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him
job	41:15	His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.
job	41:16	One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.
job	41:17	They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they
job	41:18	By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the
job	41:19	Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.
job	41:20	Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or
job	41:21	His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.
job	41:22	In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy
job	41:23	The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in
job	41:24	His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the
job	41:25	When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of
job	41:26	The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the
job	41:27	He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.
job	41:28	The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him
job	41:29	Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a
job	41:30	Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things
job	41:31	He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a
job	41:32	He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to
job	41:33	Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.
job	41:34	He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children
job	42:1	Then Job answered the LORD, and said, 42:2 I know that thou canst
job	42:3	Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I
job	42:4	Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee,
job	42:5	I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye
job	42:6	Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.
job	42:7	And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto
job	42:8	Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go
job	42:9	So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the
job	42:10	And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his
job	42:11	Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters,
job	42:12	So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his
job	42:13	He had also seven sons and three daughters.
job	42:14	And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the
job	42:15	And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters
job	42:16	After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his
job	42:17	So Job died, being old and full of days.
psa	1:1	Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly,
psa	1:2	But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he
psa	1:3	And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that
psa	1:4	The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind
psa	1:5	Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners
psa	1:6	For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the
psa	2:1	Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?
psa	2:2	The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel
psa	2:3	Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from
psa	2:4	He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have
psa	2:5	Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his
psa	2:6	Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.
psa	2:7	I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my
psa	2:8	Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine
psa	2:9	Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in
psa	2:10	Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of
psa	2:11	Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
psa	2:12	Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when
psa	3:1	Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that
psa	3:2	Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in
psa	3:3	But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up
psa	3:4	I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his
psa	3:5	I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.
psa	3:6	I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set
psa	3:7	Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine
psa	3:8	Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy
psa	4:1	Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged
psa	4:2	O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how
psa	4:3	But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for
psa	4:4	Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your
psa	4:5	Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the
psa	4:6	There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift thou
psa	4:7	Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that
psa	4:8	I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only
psa	5:1	Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.
psa	5:2	Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto
psa	5:3	My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning
psa	5:4	For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither
psa	5:5	The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers
psa	5:6	Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor
psa	5:7	But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy
psa	5:8	Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies;
psa	5:9	For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is
psa	5:10	Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels;
psa	5:11	But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them
psa	5:12	For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou
psa	6:1	O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy
psa	6:2	Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my
psa	6:3	My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?
psa	6:4	Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies’ sake.
psa	6:5	For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who
psa	6:6	I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim;
psa	6:7	Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of
psa	6:8	Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath
psa	6:9	The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my
psa	6:10	Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return
psa	7:1	O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them
psa	7:2	Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while
psa	7:3	O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my
psa	7:4	If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea,
psa	7:5	Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread
psa	7:6	Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage
psa	7:7	So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for
psa	7:8	The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my
psa	7:9	Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish
psa	7:10	My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.
psa	7:11	God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every
psa	7:12	If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and
psa	7:13	He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he
psa	7:14	Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief,
psa	7:15	He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which
psa	7:16	His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent
psa	7:17	I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will
psa	8:1	O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who
psa	8:2	Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained
psa	8:3	When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and
psa	8:4	What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man,
psa	8:5	For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast
psa	8:6	Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou
psa	8:7	All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;
psa	8:8	The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever
psa	8:9	O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
psa	9:1	I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth
psa	9:2	I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy
psa	9:3	When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at
psa	9:4	For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the
psa	9:5	Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked,
psa	9:6	O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou
psa	9:7	But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne
psa	9:8	And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister
psa	9:9	The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in
psa	9:10	And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for
psa	9:11	Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among
psa	9:12	When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he
psa	9:13	Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer of
psa	9:14	That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter
psa	9:15	The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net
psa	9:16	The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked
psa	9:17	The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that
psa	9:18	For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of
psa	9:19	Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in
psa	9:20	Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves to
psa	10:1	Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in
psa	10:2	The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be
psa	10:3	For the wicked boasteth of his heart’s desire, and blesseth the
psa	10:4	The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek
psa	10:5	His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of
psa	10:6	He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall
psa	10:7	His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his
psa	10:8	He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret
psa	10:9	He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait
psa	10:10	He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by
psa	10:11	He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his
psa	10:12	Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.
psa	10:13	Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his
psa	10:14	Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to
psa	10:15	Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his
psa	10:16	The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out
psa	10:17	LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt
psa	10:18	To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the
psa	11:1	In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird
psa	11:2	For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow
psa	11:3	If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?
psa	11:4	The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD’s throne is in heaven:
psa	11:5	The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth
psa	11:6	Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an
psa	11:7	For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth
psa	12:1	Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from
psa	12:2	They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering
psa	12:3	The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that
psa	12:4	Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our
psa	12:5	For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now
psa	12:6	The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a
psa	12:7	Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this
psa	12:8	The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.
psa	13:1	How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt
psa	13:2	How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my
psa	13:3	Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I
psa	13:4	Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that
psa	13:5	But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy
psa	13:6	I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with
psa	14:1	The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are
psa	14:2	The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see
psa	14:3	They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy:
psa	14:4	Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my
psa	14:5	There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of
psa	14:6	Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is his
psa	14:7	Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the
psa	15:1	Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy
psa	15:2	He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and
psa	15:3	He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his
psa	15:4	In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them
psa	15:5	He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward
psa	16:1	Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.
psa	16:2	O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my
psa	16:3	But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in
psa	16:4	Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god:
psa	16:5	The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou
psa	16:6	The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a
psa	16:7	I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also
psa	16:8	I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right
psa	16:9	Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also
psa	16:10	For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou
psa	16:11	Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness
psa	17:1	Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my
psa	17:2	Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes
psa	17:3	Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night;
psa	17:4	Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept
psa	17:5	Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.
psa	17:6	I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline
psa	17:7	Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy
psa	17:8	Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy
psa	17:9	From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who
psa	17:10	They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak
psa	17:11	They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their
psa	17:12	Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a
psa	17:13	Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul
psa	17:14	From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world,
psa	17:15	As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be
psa	18:1	I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.
psa	18:2	The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God,
psa	18:3	I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall
psa	18:4	The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men
psa	18:5	The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death
psa	18:6	In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he
psa	18:7	Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the
psa	18:8	There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his
psa	18:9	He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under
psa	18:10	And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the
psa	18:11	He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him
psa	18:12	At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed,
psa	18:13	The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his
psa	18:14	Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out
psa	18:15	Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of
psa	18:16	He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.
psa	18:17	He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated
psa	18:18	They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my
psa	18:19	He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me,
psa	18:20	The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to
psa	18:21	For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly
psa	18:22	For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his
psa	18:23	I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine
psa	18:24	Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my
psa	18:25	With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an
psa	18:26	With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward
psa	18:27	For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down
psa	18:28	For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my
psa	18:29	For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I
psa	18:30	As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried:
psa	18:31	For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?
psa	18:32	It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way
psa	18:33	He maketh my feet like hinds’ feet, and setteth me upon my high
psa	18:34	He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by
psa	18:35	Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy
psa	18:36	Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.
psa	18:37	I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I
psa	18:38	I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are
psa	18:39	For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast
psa	18:40	Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might
psa	18:41	They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD,
psa	18:42	Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did
psa	18:43	Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and
psa	18:44	As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers
psa	18:45	The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close
psa	18:46	The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my
psa	18:47	It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.
psa	18:48	He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up
psa	18:49	Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the
psa	18:50	Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to
psa	19:1	The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth
psa	19:2	Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth
psa	19:3	There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.
psa	19:4	Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to
psa	19:5	Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth
psa	19:6	His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit
psa	19:7	The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the
psa	19:8	The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the
psa	19:9	The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments
psa	19:10	More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold:
psa	19:11	Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them
psa	19:12	Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret
psa	19:13	Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not
psa	19:14	Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be
psa	20:1	The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of
psa	20:2	Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of
psa	20:3	Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice;
psa	20:4	Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy
psa	20:5	We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we
psa	20:6	Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him
psa	20:7	Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember
psa	20:8	They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand
psa	20:9	Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.
psa	21:1	The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation
psa	21:2	Thou hast given him his heart’s desire, and hast not withholden
psa	21:3	For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou
psa	21:4	He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of
psa	21:5	His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou
psa	21:6	For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him
psa	21:7	For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the
psa	21:8	Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall
psa	21:9	Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger:
psa	21:10	Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed
psa	21:11	For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous
psa	21:12	Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt
psa	21:13	Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing
psa	22:1	My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far
psa	22:2	O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in the
psa	22:3	But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.
psa	22:4	Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver
psa	22:5	They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee,
psa	22:6	But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of
psa	22:7	All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip,
psa	22:8	He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him deliver
psa	22:9	But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me
psa	22:10	I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my
psa	22:11	Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to
psa	22:12	Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset
psa	22:13	They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a
psa	22:14	I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint:
psa	22:15	My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth
psa	22:16	For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have
psa	22:17	I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.
psa	22:18	They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.
psa	22:19	But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee
psa	22:20	Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the
psa	22:21	Save me from the lion’s mouth: for thou hast heard me from the
psa	22:22	I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the
psa	22:23	Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob,
psa	22:24	For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the
psa	22:25	My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will pay
psa	22:26	The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD
psa	22:27	All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD:
psa	22:28	For the kingdom is the LORD’s: and he is the governor among the
psa	22:29	All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they
psa	22:30	A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a
psa	22:31	They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a
psa	23:1	The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
psa	23:2	He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside
psa	23:3	He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness
psa	23:4	Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I
psa	23:5	Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies:
psa	23:6	Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my
psa	24:1	The earth is the LORD’s, and the fulness thereof; the world, and
psa	24:2	For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the
psa	24:3	Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in
psa	24:4	He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted
psa	24:5	He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness
psa	24:6	This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face,
psa	24:7	Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting
psa	24:8	Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD
psa	24:9	Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting
psa	24:10	Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King of
psa	25:1	Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.
psa	25:2	O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine
psa	25:3	Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed
psa	25:4	Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.
psa	25:5	Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my
psa	25:6	Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses;
psa	25:7	Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions:
psa	25:8	Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in
psa	25:9	The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach
psa	25:10	All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep
psa	25:11	For thy name’s sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is
psa	25:12	What man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in the
psa	25:13	His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the
psa	25:14	The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will
psa	25:15	Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet
psa	25:16	Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and
psa	25:17	The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my
psa	25:18	Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.
psa	25:19	Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with
psa	25:20	O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put
psa	25:21	Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.
psa	25:22	Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.
psa	26:1	Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have
psa	26:2	Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.
psa	26:3	For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in
psa	26:4	I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with
psa	26:5	I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit
psa	26:6	I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine
psa	26:7	That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of
psa	26:8	LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place
psa	26:9	Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:
psa	26:10	In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of
psa	26:11	But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be
psa	26:12	My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I
psa	27:1	The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the
psa	27:2	When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to
psa	27:3	Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear:
psa	27:4	One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after;
psa	27:5	For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in
psa	27:6	And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round
psa	27:7	Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me,
psa	27:8	When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy
psa	27:9	Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger:
psa	27:10	When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take
psa	27:11	Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because
psa	27:12	Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false
psa	27:13	I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the
psa	27:14	Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen
psa	28:1	Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest,
psa	28:2	Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I
psa	28:3	Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of
psa	28:4	Give them according to their deeds, and according to the
psa	28:5	Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation
psa	28:6	Blessed be the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my
psa	28:7	The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him,
psa	28:8	The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his
psa	28:9	Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and
psa	29:1	Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and
psa	29:2	Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD
psa	29:3	The voice of the LORD is upon the waters: the God of glory
psa	29:4	The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full
psa	29:5	The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh
psa	29:6	He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like
psa	29:7	The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire.
psa	29:8	The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh
psa	29:9	The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth
psa	29:10	The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King for
psa	29:11	The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will bless
psa	30:1	I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast
psa	30:2	O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.
psa	30:3	O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast
psa	30:4	Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the
psa	30:5	For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life:
psa	30:6	And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.
psa	30:7	LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong:
psa	30:8	I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication.
psa	30:9	What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit?
psa	30:10	Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.
psa	30:11	Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put
psa	30:12	To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be
psa	31:1	In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed:
psa	31:2	Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong
psa	31:3	For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name’s
psa	31:4	Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for
psa	31:5	Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD
psa	31:6	I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the
psa	31:7	I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered
psa	31:8	And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set
psa	31:9	Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is
psa	31:10	For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my
psa	31:11	I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my
psa	31:12	I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken
psa	31:13	For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side:
psa	31:14	But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God.
psa	31:15	My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine
psa	31:16	Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy
psa	31:17	Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let
psa	31:18	Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous
psa	31:19	Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them
psa	31:20	Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the
psa	31:21	Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous
psa	31:22	For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes:
psa	31:23	O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth the
psa	31:24	Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye
psa	32:1	Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is
psa	32:2	Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and
psa	32:3	When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all
psa	32:4	For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is
psa	32:5	I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid.
psa	32:6	For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time
psa	32:7	Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble;
psa	32:8	I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt
psa	32:9	Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no
psa	32:10	Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the
psa	32:11	Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for
psa	33:1	Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for the
psa	33:2	Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and an
psa	33:3	Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.
psa	33:4	For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in
psa	33:5	He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the
psa	33:6	By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host
psa	33:7	He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth
psa	33:8	Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the
psa	33:9	For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.
psa	33:10	The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he
psa	33:11	The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his
psa	33:12	Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whom
psa	33:13	The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.
psa	33:14	From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the
psa	33:15	He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their
psa	33:16	There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man
psa	33:17	An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver
psa	33:18	Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon
psa	33:19	To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in
psa	33:20	Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.
psa	33:21	For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in
psa	33:22	Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.
psa	34:1	I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually
psa	34:2	My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear
psa	34:3	O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.
psa	34:4	I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my
psa	34:5	They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were
psa	34:6	This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of
psa	34:7	The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him,
psa	34:8	O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that
psa	34:9	O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that
psa	34:10	The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek
psa	34:11	Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of
psa	34:12	What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he
psa	34:13	Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.
psa	34:14	Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.
psa	34:15	The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are
psa	34:16	The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off
psa	34:17	The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out
psa	34:18	The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and
psa	34:19	Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD
psa	34:20	He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.
psa	34:21	Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous
psa	34:22	The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them
psa	35:1	Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight
psa	35:2	Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.
psa	35:3	Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that
psa	35:4	Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul:
psa	35:5	Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the
psa	35:6	Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD
psa	35:7	For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit, which
psa	35:8	Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that
psa	35:9	And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his
psa	35:10	All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, which
psa	35:11	False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that
psa	35:12	They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.
psa	35:13	But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I
psa	35:14	I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I
psa	35:15	But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves
psa	35:16	With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with
psa	35:17	Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their
psa	35:18	I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise
psa	35:19	Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me:
psa	35:20	For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters
psa	35:21	Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha,
psa	35:22	This thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not
psa	35:23	Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause,
psa	35:24	Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let
psa	35:25	Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let
psa	35:26	Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that
psa	35:27	Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous
psa	35:28	And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise
psa	36:1	The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that there
psa	36:2	For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be
psa	36:3	The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off
psa	36:4	He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way
psa	36:5	Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness
psa	36:6	Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments are
psa	36:7	How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the
psa	36:8	They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house;
psa	36:9	For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see
psa	36:10	O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy
psa	36:11	Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand
psa	36:12	There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down,
psa	37:1	Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious
psa	37:2	For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the
psa	37:3	Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land,
psa	37:4	Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he shall give thee the
psa	37:5	Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall
psa	37:6	And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy
psa	37:7	Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself
psa	37:8	Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise
psa	37:9	For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the
psa	37:10	For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou
psa	37:11	But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight
psa	37:12	The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with
psa	37:13	The LORD shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is
psa	37:14	The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to
psa	37:15	Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows
psa	37:16	A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of
psa	37:17	For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD
psa	37:18	The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance
psa	37:19	They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of
psa	37:20	But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall
psa	37:21	The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous
psa	37:22	For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they
psa	37:23	The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he
psa	37:24	Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD
psa	37:25	I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the
psa	37:26	He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.
psa	37:27	Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.
psa	37:28	For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they
psa	37:29	The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for
psa	37:30	The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue
psa	37:31	The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall

psa	37:33	The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he
psa	37:34	Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to
psa	37:35	I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself
psa	37:36	Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but
psa	37:37	Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of
psa	37:38	But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of
psa	37:39	But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their
psa	37:40	And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver
psa	38:1	O lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot
psa	38:2	For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.
psa	38:3	There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither
psa	38:4	For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden
psa	38:5	My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.
psa	38:6	I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day
psa	38:7	For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no
psa	38:8	I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the
psa	38:9	Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid
psa	38:10	My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of
psa	38:11	My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my
psa	38:12	They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they
psa	38:13	But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that
psa	38:14	Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no
psa	38:15	For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.
psa	38:16	For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me:
psa	38:17	For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.
psa	38:18	For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.
psa	38:19	But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that
psa	38:20	They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries;
psa	38:21	Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.
psa	38:22	Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.
psa	39:1	I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my
psa	39:2	I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my
psa	39:3	My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned:
psa	39:4	LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what
psa	39:5	Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is
psa	39:6	Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are
psa	39:7	And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.
psa	39:8	Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach
psa	39:9	I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.
psa	39:10	Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of
psa	39:11	When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou
psa	39:12	Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy
psa	39:13	O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and
psa	40:1	I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and
psa	40:2	He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry
psa	40:3	And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God:
psa	40:4	Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and
psa	40:5	Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast
psa	40:6	Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou
psa	40:7	Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written
psa	40:8	I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my
psa	40:9	I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I
psa	40:10	I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have
psa	40:11	Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy
psa	40:12	For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities
psa	40:13	Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help
psa	40:14	Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my
psa	40:15	Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto
psa	40:16	Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let
psa	40:17	But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art
psa	41:1	Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver
psa	41:2	The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be
psa	41:3	The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou
psa	41:4	I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have
psa	41:5	Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name
psa	41:6	And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth
psa	41:7	All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they
psa	41:8	An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now that
psa	41:9	Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat
psa	41:10	But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I
psa	41:11	By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth
psa	41:12	And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest
psa	41:13	Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to
psa	42:1	As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul
psa	42:2	My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come
psa	42:3	My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually
psa	42:4	When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had
psa	42:5	Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in
psa	42:6	O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I
psa	42:7	Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy
psa	42:8	Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the day time, and
psa	42:9	I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I
psa	42:10	As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while
psa	42:11	Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
psa	43:1	Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O
psa	43:2	For thou art the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me off?
psa	43:3	O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them
psa	43:4	Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy:
psa	43:5	Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
psa	44:1	We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us,
psa	44:2	How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst
psa	44:3	For they got not the land in possession by their own sword,
psa	44:4	Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.
psa	44:5	Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will
psa	44:6	For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.
psa	44:7	But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to
psa	44:8	In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever.
psa	44:9	But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth
psa	44:10	Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate
psa	44:11	Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast
psa	44:12	Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy
psa	44:13	Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a
psa	44:14	Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head
psa	44:15	My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face
psa	44:16	For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason
psa	44:17	All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee,
psa	44:18	Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined
psa	44:19	Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and
psa	44:20	If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our
psa	44:21	Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the
psa	44:22	Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted
psa	44:23	Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for
psa	44:24	Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction
psa	44:25	For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto
psa	44:26	Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies’ sake.
psa	45:1	My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I
psa	45:2	Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into
psa	45:3	Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and
psa	45:4	And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and
psa	45:5	Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king’s enemies;
psa	45:6	Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy
psa	45:7	Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God,
psa	45:8	All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of
psa	45:9	Kings’ daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right
psa	45:10	Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget
psa	45:11	So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord;
psa	45:12	And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the
psa	45:13	The king’s daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of
psa	45:14	She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the
psa	45:15	With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall
psa	45:16	Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest
psa	45:17	I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations:
psa	46:1	God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
psa	46:2	Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and
psa	46:3	Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the
psa	46:4	There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of
psa	46:5	God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall
psa	46:6	The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice,
psa	46:7	The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.
psa	46:8	Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made
psa	46:9	He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh
psa	46:10	Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the
psa	46:11	The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.
psa	47:1	O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice
psa	47:2	For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great King over all
psa	47:3	He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our
psa	47:4	He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob
psa	47:5	God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a
psa	47:6	Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King,
psa	47:7	For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with
psa	47:8	God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his
psa	47:9	The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people
psa	48:1	Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our
psa	48:2	Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount
psa	48:3	God is known in her palaces for a refuge.
psa	48:4	For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.
psa	48:5	They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and
psa	48:6	Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in
psa	48:7	Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.
psa	48:8	As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of
psa	48:9	We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy
psa	48:10	According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of
psa	48:11	Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad,
psa	48:12	Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers
psa	48:13	Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may
psa	48:14	For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide
psa	49:1	Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the
psa	49:2	Both low and high, rich and poor, together.
psa	49:3	My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart
psa	49:4	I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying
psa	49:5	Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of
psa	49:6	They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the
psa	49:7	None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God
psa	49:8	(For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for
psa	49:9	That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.
psa	49:10	For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the
psa	49:11	Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for
psa	49:12	Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the
psa	49:13	This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their
psa	49:14	Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them;
psa	49:15	But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he
psa	49:16	Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his
psa	49:17	For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall
psa	49:18	Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise
psa	49:19	He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never
psa	49:20	Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts
psa	50:1	The mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth
psa	50:2	Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.
psa	50:3	Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall
psa	50:4	He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that
psa	50:5	Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a
psa	50:6	And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge
psa	50:7	Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify
psa	50:8	I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt
psa	50:9	I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy
psa	50:10	For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a
psa	50:11	I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of
psa	50:12	If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine,
psa	50:13	Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?
psa	50:14	Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most
psa	50:15	And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and
psa	50:16	But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare
psa	50:17	Seeing thou hatest instruction, and casteth my words behind
psa	50:18	When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and
psa	50:19	Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.
psa	50:20	Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest
psa	50:21	These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest
psa	50:22	Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in
psa	50:23	Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth
psa	51:1	Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness:
psa	51:2	Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
psa	51:3	For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before
psa	51:4	Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy
psa	51:5	Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother
psa	51:6	Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the
psa	51:7	Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall
psa	51:8	Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast
psa	51:9	Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.
psa	51:10	Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit
psa	51:11	Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit
psa	51:12	Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy
psa	51:13	Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be
psa	51:14	Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my
psa	51:15	O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy
psa	51:16	For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou
psa	51:17	The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a
psa	51:18	Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of
psa	51:19	Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness,
psa	52:1	Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness
psa	52:2	The tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working
psa	52:3	Thou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to speak
psa	52:4	Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.
psa	52:5	God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee
psa	52:6	The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:
psa	52:7	Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but trusted
psa	52:8	But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in
psa	52:9	I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I
psa	53:1	The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are
psa	53:2	God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if
psa	53:3	Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become
psa	53:4	Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people
psa	53:5	There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath
psa	53:6	Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God
psa	54:1	Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.
psa	54:2	Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.
psa	54:3	For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after
psa	54:4	Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my
psa	54:5	He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy
psa	54:6	I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O
psa	54:7	For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath
psa	55:1	Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my
psa	55:2	Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a
psa	55:3	Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of
psa	55:4	My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are
psa	55:5	Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath
psa	55:6	And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly
psa	55:7	Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness.
psa	55:8	I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.
psa	55:9	Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen
psa	55:10	Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief
psa	55:11	Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not
psa	55:12	For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have
psa	55:13	But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine
psa	55:14	We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God
psa	55:15	Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell:
psa	55:16	As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.
psa	55:17	Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud:
psa	55:18	He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was
psa	55:19	God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old.
psa	55:20	He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with
psa	55:21	The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in
psa	55:22	Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he
psa	55:23	But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of
psa	56:1	Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he
psa	56:2	Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that
psa	56:3	What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.
psa	56:4	In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will
psa	56:5	Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me
psa	56:6	They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark
psa	56:7	Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the
psa	56:8	Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle:
psa	56:9	When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I
psa	56:10	In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his
psa	56:11	In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do
psa	56:12	Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.
psa	56:13	For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou
psa	57:1	Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul
psa	57:2	I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all
psa	57:3	He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him
psa	57:4	My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on
psa	57:5	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above
psa	57:6	They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down:
psa	57:7	My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give
psa	57:8	Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake
psa	57:9	I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto
psa	57:10	For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the
psa	57:11	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be
psa	58:1	Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge
psa	58:2	Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your
psa	58:3	The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as
psa	58:4	Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the
psa	58:5	Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never
psa	58:6	Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great
psa	58:7	Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he
psa	58:8	As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away: like
psa	58:9	Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as
psa	58:10	The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he
psa	58:11	So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the
psa	59:1	Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that
psa	59:2	Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody
psa	59:3	For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered
psa	59:4	They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to help
psa	59:5	Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to
psa	59:6	They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go
psa	59:7	Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their
psa	59:8	But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the
psa	59:9	Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my
psa	59:10	The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my
psa	59:11	Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power;
psa	59:12	For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them
psa	59:13	Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and
psa	59:14	And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like a
psa	59:15	Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not
psa	59:16	But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy
psa	59:17	Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence,
psa	60:1	O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast
psa	60:2	Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal
psa	60:3	Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to
psa	60:4	Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be
psa	60:5	That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and
psa	60:6	God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide
psa	60:7	Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the
psa	60:8	Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia,
psa	60:9	Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into
psa	60:10	Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O God,
psa	60:11	Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.
psa	60:12	Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread
psa	61:1	Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.
psa	61:2	From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is
psa	61:3	For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the
psa	61:4	I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the
psa	61:5	For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the
psa	61:6	Thou wilt prolong the king’s life: and his years as many
psa	61:7	He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth,
psa	61:8	So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily
psa	62:1	Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.
psa	62:2	He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall
psa	62:3	How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be
psa	62:4	They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they
psa	62:5	My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.
psa	62:6	He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall
psa	62:7	In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and
psa	62:8	Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before
psa	62:9	Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a
psa	62:10	Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if
psa	62:11	God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power
psa	62:12	Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to
psa	63:1	O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth
psa	63:2	To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the
psa	63:3	Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall
psa	63:4	Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in
psa	63:5	My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my
psa	63:6	When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the
psa	63:7	Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy
psa	63:8	My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.
psa	63:9	But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the
psa	63:10	They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes.
psa	63:11	But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by
psa	64:1	Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of
psa	64:2	Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the
psa	64:3	Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot
psa	64:4	That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they
psa	64:5	They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of
psa	64:6	They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search:
psa	64:7	But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be
psa	64:8	So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all
psa	64:9	And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for
psa	64:10	The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him;
psa	65:1	Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the
psa	65:2	O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.
psa	65:3	Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou
psa	65:4	Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach
psa	65:5	By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of
psa	65:6	Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded
psa	65:7	Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves,
psa	65:8	They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy
psa	65:9	Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest
psa	65:10	Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the
psa	65:11	Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop
psa	65:12	They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little
psa	65:13	The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are
psa	66:1	Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:
psa	66:2	Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.
psa	66:3	Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the
psa	66:4	All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they
psa	66:5	Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing toward
psa	66:6	He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood on
psa	66:7	He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let
psa	66:8	O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to
psa	66:9	Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be
psa	66:10	For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver
psa	66:11	Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our
psa	66:12	Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through
psa	66:13	I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee
psa	66:14	Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was
psa	66:15	I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the
psa	66:16	Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he
psa	66:17	I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my
psa	66:18	If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:
psa	66:19	But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of
psa	66:20	Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his
psa	67:1	God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to
psa	67:2	That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all
psa	67:3	Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise
psa	67:4	O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge
psa	67:5	Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise
psa	67:6	Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own
psa	67:7	God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.
psa	68:1	Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that
psa	68:2	As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth
psa	68:3	But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea,
psa	68:4	Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth
psa	68:5	A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in
psa	68:6	God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which
psa	68:7	O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst
psa	68:8	The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God:
psa	68:9	Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst
psa	68:10	Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared
psa	68:11	The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that
psa	68:12	Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home
psa	68:13	Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings
psa	68:14	When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow in
psa	68:15	The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the
psa	68:16	Why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill which God desireth
psa	68:17	The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of
psa	68:18	Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive:
psa	68:19	Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even
psa	68:20	He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD the
psa	68:21	But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp
psa	68:22	The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my
psa	68:23	That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and
psa	68:24	They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my
psa	68:25	The singers went before, the players on instruments followed
psa	68:26	Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the
psa	68:27	There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of Judah
psa	68:28	Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that
psa	68:29	Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents
psa	68:30	Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with
psa	68:31	Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out
psa	68:32	Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the
psa	68:33	To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of
psa	68:34	Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel, and
psa	68:35	O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of
psa	69:1	Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.
psa	69:2	I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into
psa	69:3	I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while
psa	69:4	They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine
psa	69:5	O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from
psa	69:6	Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed
psa	69:7	Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my
psa	69:8	I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my
psa	69:9	For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches
psa	69:10	When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my
psa	69:11	I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to
psa	69:12	They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song
psa	69:13	But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable
psa	69:14	Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be
psa	69:15	Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow
psa	69:16	Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me
psa	69:17	And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble:
psa	69:18	Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of
psa	69:19	Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour:
psa	69:20	Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I
psa	69:21	They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave
psa	69:22	Let their table become a snare before them: and that which
psa	69:23	Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their
psa	69:24	Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger
psa	69:25	Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their
psa	69:26	For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to
psa	69:27	Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy
psa	69:28	Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be
psa	69:29	But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up
psa	69:30	I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him
psa	69:31	This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock
psa	69:32	The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall
psa	69:33	For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.
psa	69:34	Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing
psa	69:35	For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that
psa	69:36	The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that
psa	70:1	Make haste, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O Lord.
psa	70:2	Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let
psa	70:3	Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say,
psa	70:4	Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let
psa	70:5	But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art my
psa	71:1	In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to
psa	71:2	Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline
psa	71:3	Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort:
psa	71:4	Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the
psa	71:5	For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my
psa	71:6	By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that
psa	71:7	I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.
psa	71:8	Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all
psa	71:9	Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my
psa	71:10	For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my
psa	71:11	Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for there
psa	71:12	O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.
psa	71:13	Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my
psa	71:14	But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and
psa	71:15	My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation
psa	71:16	I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention
psa	71:17	O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I
psa	71:18	Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not;
psa	71:19	Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done great
psa	71:20	Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt
psa	71:21	Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.
psa	71:22	I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my
psa	71:23	My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my
psa	71:24	My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long:
psa	72:1	Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto
psa	72:2	He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with
psa	72:3	The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little
psa	72:4	He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children
psa	72:5	They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure,
psa	72:6	He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers that
psa	72:7	In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace
psa	72:8	He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river
psa	72:9	They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his
psa	72:10	The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the
psa	72:11	Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall
psa	72:12	For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also,
psa	72:13	He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of
psa	72:14	He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and
psa	72:15	And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of
psa	72:16	There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of
psa	72:17	His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as
psa	72:18	Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth
psa	72:19	And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole
psa	72:20	The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
psa	73:1	Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean
psa	73:2	But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh
psa	73:3	For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of
psa	73:4	For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is
psa	73:5	They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued
psa	73:6	Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence
psa	73:7	Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart
psa	73:8	They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they
psa	73:9	They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue
psa	73:10	Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are
psa	73:11	And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the
psa	73:12	Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they
psa	73:13	Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in
psa	73:14	For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every
psa	73:15	If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the
psa	73:16	When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;
psa	73:17	Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their
psa	73:18	Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst
psa	73:19	How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are
psa	73:20	As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou
psa	73:21	Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.
psa	73:22	So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.
psa	73:23	Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by
psa	73:24	Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me
psa	73:25	Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth
psa	73:26	My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my
psa	73:27	For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast
psa	73:28	But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust
psa	74:1	O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger
psa	74:2	Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the
psa	74:3	Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that
psa	74:4	Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up
psa	74:5	A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the
psa	74:6	But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes
psa	74:7	They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by
psa	74:8	They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they
psa	74:9	We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is
psa	74:10	O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy
psa	74:11	Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out
psa	74:12	For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the
psa	74:13	Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the
psa	74:14	Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to
psa	74:15	Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up
psa	74:16	The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared
psa	74:17	Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made
psa	74:18	Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that
psa	74:19	O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of
psa	74:20	Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth
psa	74:21	O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy
psa	74:22	Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish
psa	74:23	Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that
psa	75:1	Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks:
psa	75:2	When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.
psa	75:3	The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear
psa	75:4	I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked,
psa	75:5	Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.
psa	75:6	For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west,
psa	75:7	But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up
psa	75:8	For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red;
psa	75:9	But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of
psa	75:10	All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns
psa	76:1	In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.
psa	76:2	In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.
psa	76:3	There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword,
psa	76:4	Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.
psa	76:5	The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and
psa	76:6	At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are
psa	76:7	Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight
psa	76:8	Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth
psa	76:9	When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth.
psa	76:10	Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of
psa	76:11	Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about
psa	76:12	He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the
psa	77:1	I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and
psa	77:2	In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the
psa	77:3	I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit
psa	77:4	Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot
psa	77:5	I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.
psa	77:6	I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine
psa	77:7	Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no
psa	77:8	Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for
psa	77:9	Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his
psa	77:10	And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years
psa	77:11	I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember
psa	77:12	I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.
psa	77:13	Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as
psa	77:14	Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy
psa	77:15	Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob
psa	77:16	The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were
psa	77:17	The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine
psa	77:18	The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings
psa	77:19	Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy
psa	77:20	Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and
psa	78:1	Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words
psa	78:2	I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of
psa	78:3	Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
psa	78:4	We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the
psa	78:5	For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in
psa	78:6	That the generation to come might know them, even the children
psa	78:7	That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works
psa	78:8	And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious
psa	78:9	The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned
psa	78:10	They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his
psa	78:11	And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.
psa	78:12	Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the
psa	78:13	He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made
psa	78:14	In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night
psa	78:15	He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out
psa	78:16	He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to
psa	78:17	And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High
psa	78:18	And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their
psa	78:19	Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table
psa	78:20	Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the
psa	78:21	Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was
psa	78:22	Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his
psa	78:23	Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the
psa	78:24	And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them
psa	78:25	Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full.
psa	78:26	He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power
psa	78:27	He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like
psa	78:28	And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their
psa	78:29	So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their
psa	78:30	They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat
psa	78:31	The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them,
psa	78:32	For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his
psa	78:33	Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years
psa	78:34	When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and
psa	78:35	And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God
psa	78:36	Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they
psa	78:37	For their heart was not right with him, neither were they
psa	78:38	But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and
psa	78:39	For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth
psa	78:40	How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him
psa	78:41	Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One
psa	78:42	They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them
psa	78:43	How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the
psa	78:44	And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that
psa	78:45	He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them;
psa	78:46	He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their
psa	78:47	He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees
psa	78:48	He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to
psa	78:49	He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and
psa	78:50	He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death,
psa	78:51	And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their
psa	78:52	But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them
psa	78:53	And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea
psa	78:54	And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this
psa	78:55	He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an
psa	78:56	Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not
psa	78:57	But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they
psa	78:58	For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved
psa	78:59	When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:
psa	78:60	So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he
psa	78:61	And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into
psa	78:62	He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with
psa	78:63	The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not
psa	78:64	Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no
psa	78:65	Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man
psa	78:66	And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a
psa	78:67	Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the
psa	78:68	But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
psa	78:69	And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth
psa	78:70	He chose David also his servant, and took him from the
psa	78:71	From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed
psa	78:72	So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and
psa	79:1	O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy
psa	79:2	The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto
psa	79:3	Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and
psa	79:4	We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision
psa	79:5	How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy
psa	79:6	Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and
psa	79:7	For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.
psa	79:8	O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender
psa	79:9	Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and
psa	79:10	Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be
psa	79:11	Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to
psa	79:12	And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their
psa	79:13	So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks
psa	80:1	Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a
psa	80:2	Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength,
psa	80:3	Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall
psa	80:4	O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the
psa	80:5	Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears
psa	80:6	Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies
psa	80:7	Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and
psa	80:8	Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the
psa	80:9	Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep
psa	80:10	The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs
psa	80:11	She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the
psa	80:12	Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they
psa	80:13	The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of
psa	80:14	Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven,
psa	80:15	And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the
psa	80:16	It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the
psa	80:17	Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of
psa	80:18	So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call
psa	80:19	Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and
psa	81:1	Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the
psa	81:2	Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp
psa	81:3	Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on
psa	81:4	For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob.
psa	81:5	This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out
psa	81:6	I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered
psa	81:7	Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee
psa	81:8	Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if
psa	81:9	There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship
psa	81:10	I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of
psa	81:11	But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would
psa	81:12	So I gave them up unto their own hearts’ lust: and they walked
psa	81:13	Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked
psa	81:14	I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand
psa	81:15	The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto
psa	81:16	He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and
psa	82:1	God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among
psa	82:2	How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the
psa	82:3	Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and
psa	82:4	Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the
psa	82:5	They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in
psa	82:6	I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most
psa	82:7	But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.
psa	82:8	Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all
psa	83:1	Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not
psa	83:2	For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee
psa	83:3	They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted
psa	83:4	They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a
psa	83:5	For they have consulted together with one consent: they are
psa	83:6	The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the
psa	83:7	Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the
psa	83:8	Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of
psa	83:9	Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin,
psa	83:10	Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.
psa	83:11	Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their
psa	83:12	Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in
psa	83:13	O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the
psa	83:14	As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the
psa	83:15	So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with
psa	83:16	Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O
psa	83:17	Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be
psa	83:18	That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art
psa	84:1	How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!
psa	84:2	My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD:
psa	84:3	Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for
psa	84:4	Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still
psa	84:5	Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are
psa	84:6	Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain
psa	84:7	They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion
psa	84:8	O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob.
psa	84:9	Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine
psa	84:10	For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather
psa	84:11	For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace
psa	84:12	O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.
psa	85:1	Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought
psa	85:2	Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered
psa	85:3	Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from
psa	85:4	Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us
psa	85:5	Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine
psa	85:6	Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in
psa	85:7	Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.
psa	85:8	I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace
psa	85:9	Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may
psa	85:10	Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have
psa	85:11	Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall
psa	85:12	Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall
psa	85:13	Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way
psa	86:1	Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy.
psa	86:2	Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy servant
psa	86:3	Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.
psa	86:4	Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift
psa	86:5	For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in
psa	86:6	Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my
psa	86:7	In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt
psa	86:8	Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are
psa	86:9	All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before
psa	86:10	For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God
psa	86:11	Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my
psa	86:12	I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will
psa	86:13	For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my
psa	86:14	O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of
psa	86:15	But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious,
psa	86:16	O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto
psa	86:17	Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it,
psa	87:1	His foundation is in the holy mountains.
psa	87:2	The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of
psa	87:3	Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.
psa	87:4	I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me:
psa	87:5	And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her:
psa	87:6	The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this
psa	87:7	As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there:
psa	88:1	O lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before
psa	88:2	Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;
psa	88:3	For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto
psa	88:4	I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man
psa	88:5	Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom
psa	88:6	Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.
psa	88:7	Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all
psa	88:8	Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made
psa	88:9	Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called
psa	88:10	Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and
psa	88:11	Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy
psa	88:12	Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in
psa	88:13	But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my
psa	88:14	LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face
psa	88:15	I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer
psa	88:16	Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.
psa	88:17	They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me
psa	88:18	Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine
psa	89:1	I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth
psa	89:2	For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy
psa	89:3	I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my
psa	89:4	Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to
psa	89:5	And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy
psa	89:6	For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among
psa	89:7	God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to
psa	89:8	O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or to
psa	89:9	Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise,
psa	89:10	Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou
psa	89:11	The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world
psa	89:12	The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon
psa	89:13	Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy
psa	89:14	Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and
psa	89:15	Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall
psa	89:16	In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy
psa	89:17	For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our
psa	89:18	For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our
psa	89:19	Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have
psa	89:20	I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed
psa	89:21	With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall
psa	89:22	The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness
psa	89:23	And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them
psa	89:24	But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my
psa	89:25	I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the
psa	89:26	He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock
psa	89:27	Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the
psa	89:28	My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall
psa	89:29	His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as
psa	89:30	If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;
psa	89:31	If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;
psa	89:32	Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their
psa	89:33	Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him,
psa	89:34	My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone
psa	89:35	Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.
psa	89:36	His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before
psa	89:37	It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful
psa	89:38	But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with
psa	89:39	Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast
psa	89:40	Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his
psa	89:41	All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his
psa	89:42	Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast
psa	89:43	Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made
psa	89:44	Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to
psa	89:45	The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him
psa	89:46	How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath
psa	89:47	Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men
psa	89:48	What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he
psa	89:49	Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest
psa	89:50	Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in
psa	89:51	Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they
psa	89:52	Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.
psa	90:1	Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.
psa	90:2	Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst
psa	90:3	Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children
psa	90:4	For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is
psa	90:5	Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in
psa	90:6	In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it
psa	90:7	For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we
psa	90:8	Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the
psa	90:9	For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years
psa	90:10	The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by
psa	90:11	Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy
psa	90:12	So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts
psa	90:13	Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy
psa	90:14	O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be
psa	90:15	Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted
psa	90:16	Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their
psa	90:17	And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish
psa	91:1	He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide
psa	91:2	I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God;
psa	91:3	Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and
psa	91:4	He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt
psa	91:5	Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the
psa	91:6	Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the
psa	91:7	A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right
psa	91:8	Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the
psa	91:9	Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the
psa	91:10	There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come
psa	91:11	For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in
psa	91:12	They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot
psa	91:13	Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the
psa	91:14	Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver
psa	91:15	He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him
psa	91:16	With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.
psa	92:1	It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing
psa	92:2	To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy
psa	92:3	Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon
psa	92:4	For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will
psa	92:5	O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep.
psa	92:6	A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.
psa	92:7	When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of
psa	92:8	But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.
psa	92:9	For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall
psa	92:10	But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I
psa	92:11	Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears
psa	92:12	The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow
psa	92:13	Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in
psa	92:14	They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat
psa	92:15	To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is no
psa	93:1	The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is
psa	93:2	Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.
psa	93:3	The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up
psa	93:4	The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea,
psa	93:5	Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O
psa	94:1	O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance
psa	94:2	Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the
psa	94:3	LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked
psa	94:4	How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the
psa	94:5	They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine
psa	94:6	They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.
psa	94:7	Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of
psa	94:8	Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will
psa	94:9	He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the
psa	94:10	He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that
psa	94:11	The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.
psa	94:12	Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest
psa	94:13	That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until
psa	94:14	For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he
psa	94:15	But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the
psa	94:16	Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand
psa	94:17	Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in
psa	94:18	When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.
psa	94:19	In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight
psa	94:20	Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which
psa	94:21	They gather themselves together against the soul of the
psa	94:22	But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge.
psa	94:23	And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut
psa	95:1	O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to
psa	95:2	Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a
psa	95:3	For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.
psa	95:4	In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the
psa	95:5	The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry
psa	95:6	O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD
psa	95:7	For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the
psa	95:8	Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day
psa	95:9	When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.
psa	95:10	Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said,
psa	95:11	Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my
psa	96:1	O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the
psa	96:2	Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from
psa	96:3	Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all
psa	96:4	For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be
psa	96:5	For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made the
psa	96:6	Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his
psa	96:7	Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the
psa	96:8	Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an
psa	96:9	O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him,
psa	96:10	Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also
psa	96:11	Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea
psa	96:12	Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all
psa	96:13	Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the
psa	97:1	The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of
psa	97:2	Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and
psa	97:3	A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about.
psa	97:4	His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and
psa	97:5	The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the
psa	97:6	The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his
psa	97:7	Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast
psa	97:8	Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced
psa	97:9	For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted
psa	97:10	Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his
psa	97:11	Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in
psa	97:12	Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the
psa	98:1	O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous
psa	98:2	The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he
psa	98:3	He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of
psa	98:4	Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud
psa	98:5	Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of
psa	98:6	With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the
psa	98:7	Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they
psa	98:8	Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together
psa	98:9	Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with
psa	99:1	The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the
psa	99:2	The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the people.
psa	99:3	Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy.
psa	99:4	The king’s strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish
psa	99:5	Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for he
psa	99:6	Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that
psa	99:7	He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his
psa	99:8	Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that
psa	99:9	Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the
psa	100:1	Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.
psa	100:2	Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with
psa	100:3	Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and
psa	100:4	Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with
psa	100:5	For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth
psa	101:1	I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I
psa	101:2	I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou
psa	101:3	I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of
psa	101:4	A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked
psa	101:5	Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him
psa	101:6	Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may
psa	101:7	He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that
psa	101:8	I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut
psa	102:1	Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.
psa	102:2	Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble;
psa	102:3	For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as
psa	102:4	My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget
psa	102:5	By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my
psa	102:6	I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the
psa	102:7	I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.
psa	102:8	Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad
psa	102:9	For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with
psa	102:10	Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast
psa	102:11	My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered
psa	102:12	But thou, O LORD, shall endure for ever; and thy remembrance
psa	102:13	Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to
psa	102:14	For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the
psa	102:15	So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the
psa	102:16	When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his
psa	102:17	He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise
psa	102:18	This shall be written for the generation to come: and the
psa	102:19	For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from
psa	102:20	To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are
psa	102:21	To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in
psa	102:22	When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to
psa	102:23	He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.
psa	102:24	I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy
psa	102:25	Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the
psa	102:26	They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them
psa	102:27	But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.
psa	102:28	The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed
psa	103:1	Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his
psa	103:2	Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:
psa	103:3	Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy
psa	103:4	Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with
psa	103:5	Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is
psa	103:6	The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are
psa	103:7	He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of
psa	103:8	The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous
psa	103:9	He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for
psa	103:10	He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us
psa	103:11	For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his
psa	103:12	As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our
psa	103:13	Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them
psa	103:14	For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.
psa	103:15	As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so
psa	103:16	For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place
psa	103:17	But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting
psa	103:18	To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his
psa	103:19	The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his
psa	103:20	Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do
psa	103:21	Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that
psa	103:22	Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion:
psa	104:1	Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great;
psa	104:2	Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who
psa	104:3	Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh
psa	104:4	Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:
psa	104:5	Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be
psa	104:6	Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters
psa	104:7	At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted
psa	104:8	They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto
psa	104:9	Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they
psa	104:10	He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the
psa	104:11	They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses
psa	104:12	By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation,
psa	104:13	He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied
psa	104:14	He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the
psa	104:15	And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his
psa	104:16	The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon,
psa	104:17	Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir
psa	104:18	The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks
psa	104:19	He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going
psa	104:20	Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts
psa	104:21	The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from
psa	104:22	The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them
psa	104:23	Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the
psa	104:24	O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made
psa	104:25	So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping
psa	104:26	There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast
psa	104:27	These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat
psa	104:28	That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand,
psa	104:29	Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their
psa	104:30	Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou
psa	104:31	The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall
psa	104:32	He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the
psa	104:33	I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise
psa	104:34	My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the
psa	104:35	Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the
psa	105:1	O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his
psa	105:2	Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous
psa	105:3	Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that
psa	105:4	Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.
psa	105:5	Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders,
psa	105:6	O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his
psa	105:7	He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.
psa	105:8	He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he
psa	105:9	Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;
psa	105:10	And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for
psa	105:11	Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of
psa	105:12	When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and
psa	105:13	When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to
psa	105:14	He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for
psa	105:15	Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.
psa	105:16	Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the
psa	105:17	He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a
psa	105:18	Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:
psa	105:19	Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried
psa	105:20	The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and
psa	105:21	He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:
psa	105:22	To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators
psa	105:23	Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of
psa	105:24	And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger
psa	105:25	He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with
psa	105:26	He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.
psa	105:27	They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of
psa	105:28	He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not
psa	105:29	He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.
psa	105:30	Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of
psa	105:31	He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all
psa	105:32	He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.
psa	105:33	He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the
psa	105:34	He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that
psa	105:35	And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the
psa	105:36	He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all
psa	105:37	He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was
psa	105:38	Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell
psa	105:39	He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the
psa	105:40	The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them
psa	105:41	He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the
psa	105:42	For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.
psa	105:43	And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with
psa	105:44	And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the
psa	105:45	That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise
psa	106:1	Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good:
psa	106:2	Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth
psa	106:3	Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth
psa	106:4	Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy
psa	106:5	That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the
psa	106:6	We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we
psa	106:7	Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered
psa	106:8	Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might
psa	106:9	He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them
psa	106:10	And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and
psa	106:11	And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them
psa	106:12	Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.
psa	106:13	They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:
psa	106:14	But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in
psa	106:15	And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their
psa	106:16	They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the
psa	106:17	The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the
psa	106:18	And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up
psa	106:19	They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.
psa	106:20	Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that
psa	106:21	They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in
psa	106:22	Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the
psa	106:23	Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his
psa	106:24	Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his
psa	106:25	But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice
psa	106:26	Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them
psa	106:27	To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter
psa	106:28	They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the
psa	106:29	Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the
psa	106:30	Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the
psa	106:31	And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all
psa	106:32	They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went
psa	106:33	Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly
psa	106:34	They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD
psa	106:35	But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.
psa	106:36	And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.
psa	106:37	Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto
psa	106:38	And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of
psa	106:39	Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring
psa	106:40	Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people,
psa	106:41	And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that
psa	106:42	Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into
psa	106:43	Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with
psa	106:44	Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their
psa	106:45	And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according
psa	106:46	He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them
psa	106:47	Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen,
psa	106:48	Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to
psa	107:1	O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy
psa	107:2	Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from
psa	107:3	And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the
psa	107:4	They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no
psa	107:5	Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
psa	107:6	Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered
psa	107:7	And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a
psa	107:8	Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
psa	107:9	For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul
psa	107:10	Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound
psa	107:11	Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned
psa	107:12	Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell
psa	107:13	Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved
psa	107:14	He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and
psa	107:15	Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
psa	107:16	For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron
psa	107:17	Fools because of their transgression, and because of their
psa	107:18	Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near
psa	107:19	Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth
psa	107:20	He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from
psa	107:21	Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
psa	107:22	And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and
psa	107:23	They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in
psa	107:24	These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.
psa	107:25	For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth
psa	107:26	They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths:
psa	107:27	They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are
psa	107:28	Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth
psa	107:29	He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are
psa	107:30	Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them
psa	107:31	Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
psa	107:32	Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and
psa	107:33	He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into
psa	107:34	A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them
psa	107:35	He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground
psa	107:36	And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare
psa	107:37	And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits
psa	107:38	He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and
psa	107:39	Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression,
psa	107:40	He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in
psa	107:41	Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him
psa	107:42	The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall
psa	107:43	Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall
psa	108:1	O god, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with
psa	108:2	Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.
psa	108:3	I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing
psa	108:4	For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth
psa	108:5	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above
psa	108:6	That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and
psa	108:7	God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide
psa	108:8	Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength
psa	108:9	Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over
psa	108:10	Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into
psa	108:11	Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou,
psa	108:12	Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.
psa	108:13	Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall
psa	109:1	Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;
psa	109:2	For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are
psa	109:3	They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought
psa	109:4	For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto
psa	109:5	And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
psa	109:6	Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right
psa	109:7	When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his
psa	109:8	Let his days be few; and let another take his office.
psa	109:9	Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.
psa	109:10	Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them
psa	109:11	Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the
psa	109:12	Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there
psa	109:13	Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following
psa	109:14	Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD;
psa	109:15	Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off
psa	109:16	Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted
psa	109:17	As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted
psa	109:18	As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so
psa	109:19	Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a
psa	109:20	Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and
psa	109:21	But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name’s sake:
psa	109:22	For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
psa	109:23	I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and
psa	109:24	My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of
psa	109:25	I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me
psa	109:26	Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:
psa	109:27	That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast
psa	109:28	Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be
psa	109:29	Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover
psa	109:30	I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will
psa	109:31	For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him
psa	110:1	The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I
psa	110:2	The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule
psa	110:3	Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the
psa	110:4	The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for
psa	110:5	The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day
psa	110:6	He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with
psa	110:7	He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift
psa	111:1	Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole heart,
psa	111:2	The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that
psa	111:3	His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness
psa	111:4	He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is
psa	111:5	He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be
psa	111:6	He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may
psa	111:7	The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his
psa	111:8	They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and
psa	111:9	He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his
psa	111:10	The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good
psa	112:1	Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD,
psa	112:2	His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the
psa	112:3	Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness
psa	112:4	Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is
psa	112:5	A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his
psa	112:6	Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in
psa	112:7	He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed,
psa	112:8	His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see
psa	112:9	He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness
psa	112:10	The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with
psa	113:1	Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise
psa	113:2	Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for
psa	113:3	From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the
psa	113:4	The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the
psa	113:5	Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,
psa	113:6	Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven,
psa	113:7	He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy
psa	113:8	That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his
psa	113:9	He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful
psa	114:1	When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people
psa	114:2	Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.
psa	114:3	The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.
psa	114:4	The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like
psa	114:5	What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan,
psa	114:6	Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills,
psa	114:7	Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the
psa	114:8	Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a
psa	115:1	Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory,
psa	115:2	Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?
psa	115:3	But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath
psa	115:4	Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands.
psa	115:5	They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they
psa	115:6	They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they
psa	115:7	They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they
psa	115:8	They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that
psa	115:9	O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their
psa	115:10	O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their
psa	115:11	Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and
psa	115:12	The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will
psa	115:13	He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.
psa	115:14	The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your
psa	115:15	Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.
psa	115:16	The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD’s: but the earth
psa	115:17	The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into
psa	115:18	But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for
psa	116:1	I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my
psa	116:2	Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call
psa	116:3	The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat
psa	116:4	Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee,
psa	116:5	Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.
psa	116:6	The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped
psa	116:7	Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt
psa	116:8	For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from
psa	116:9	I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.
psa	116:10	I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:
psa	116:11	I said in my haste, All men are liars.
psa	116:12	What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward
psa	116:13	I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the
psa	116:14	I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his
psa	116:15	Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.
psa	116:16	O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son
psa	116:17	I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will
psa	116:18	I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his
psa	116:19	In the courts of the LORD’s house, in the midst of thee, O
psa	117:1	O praise the LORD, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people.
psa	117:2	For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of
psa	118:1	O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: because his mercy
psa	118:2	Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.
psa	118:3	Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for
psa	118:4	Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth for
psa	118:5	I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, and
psa	118:6	The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto
psa	118:7	The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall
psa	118:8	It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.
psa	118:9	It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in
psa	118:10	All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD
psa	118:11	They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in
psa	118:12	They compassed me about like bees: they are quenched as the
psa	118:13	Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD
psa	118:14	The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.
psa	118:15	The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of
psa	118:16	The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the
psa	118:17	I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.
psa	118:18	The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over
psa	118:19	Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and
psa	118:20	This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.
psa	118:21	I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my
psa	118:22	The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone
psa	118:23	This is the LORD’s doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.
psa	118:24	This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and
psa	118:25	Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send
psa	118:26	Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have
psa	118:27	God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice
psa	118:28	Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I
psa	118:29	O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy
psa	119:1	Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the
psa	119:2	Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him
psa	119:3	They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.
psa	119:4	Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.
psa	119:5	O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!
psa	119:6	Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy
psa	119:7	I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have
psa	119:8	I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.
psa	119:9	Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed
psa	119:10	With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander
psa	119:11	Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against
psa	119:12	Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.
psa	119:13	With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.
psa	119:14	I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in
psa	119:15	I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy
psa	119:16	I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy
psa	119:17	Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep
psa	119:18	Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of
psa	119:19	I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from
psa	119:20	My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy
psa	119:21	Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from
psa	119:22	Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy
psa	119:23	Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did
psa	119:24	Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.
psa	119:25	My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to
psa	119:26	I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy
psa	119:27	Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk
psa	119:28	My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according
psa	119:29	Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law
psa	119:30	I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid
psa	119:31	I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame.
psa	119:32	I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge
psa	119:33	Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it
psa	119:34	Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall
psa	119:35	Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I
psa	119:36	Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.
psa	119:37	Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me
psa	119:38	Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear.
psa	119:39	Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are good.
psa	119:40	Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy
psa	119:41	Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation,
psa	119:42	So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me:
psa	119:43	And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I
psa	119:44	So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.
psa	119:45	And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.
psa	119:46	I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not
psa	119:47	And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have
psa	119:48	My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I
psa	119:49	Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused
psa	119:50	This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath
psa	119:51	The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not
psa	119:52	I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted
psa	119:53	Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that
psa	119:54	Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.
psa	119:55	I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept
psa	119:56	This I had, because I kept thy precepts.
psa	119:57	Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy
psa	119:58	I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me
psa	119:59	I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.
psa	119:60	I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.
psa	119:61	The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not
psa	119:62	At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy
psa	119:63	I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that
psa	119:64	The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes.
psa	119:65	Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto
psa	119:66	Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy
psa	119:67	Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy
psa	119:68	Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.
psa	119:69	The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy
psa	119:70	Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law.
psa	119:71	It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might
psa	119:72	The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold
psa	119:73	Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding,
psa	119:74	They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I
psa	119:75	I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in
psa	119:76	Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort,
psa	119:77	Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy
psa	119:78	Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me
psa	119:79	Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have
psa	119:80	Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.
psa	119:81	My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word.
psa	119:82	Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?
psa	119:83	For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget
psa	119:84	How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute
psa	119:85	The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law.
psa	119:86	All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me
psa	119:87	They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy
psa	119:88	Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the
psa	119:89	For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.
psa	119:90	Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established
psa	119:91	They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all
psa	119:92	Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have
psa	119:93	I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast
psa	119:94	I am thine, save me: for I have sought thy precepts.
psa	119:95	The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will
psa	119:96	I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is
psa	119:97	O how I love thy law! it is my meditation all the day.
psa	119:98	Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine
psa	119:99	I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy
psa	119:100	I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy
psa	119:101	I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might
psa	119:102	I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught
psa	119:103	How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey
psa	119:104	Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate
psa	119:105	Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.
psa	119:106	I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy
psa	119:107	I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto
psa	119:108	Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O
psa	119:109	My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy
psa	119:110	The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy
psa	119:111	Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they
psa	119:112	I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even
psa	119:113	I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.
psa	119:114	Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.
psa	119:115	Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments
psa	119:116	Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me
psa	119:117	Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect
psa	119:118	Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes:
psa	119:119	Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross:
psa	119:120	My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy
psa	119:121	I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine
psa	119:122	Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress
psa	119:123	Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy
psa	119:124	Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me
psa	119:125	I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy
psa	119:126	It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void
psa	119:127	Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine
psa	119:128	Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to
psa	119:129	Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep
psa	119:130	The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth
psa	119:131	I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy
psa	119:132	Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to
psa	119:133	Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have
psa	119:134	Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy
psa	119:135	Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy
psa	119:136	Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy
psa	119:137	Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments.
psa	119:138	Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and
psa	119:139	My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten
psa	119:140	Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.
psa	119:141	I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts.
psa	119:142	Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law
psa	119:143	Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy
psa	119:144	The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me
psa	119:145	I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy
psa	119:146	I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.
psa	119:147	I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in
psa	119:148	Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in
psa	119:149	Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD,
psa	119:150	They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from
psa	119:151	Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are truth.
psa	119:152	Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast
psa	119:153	Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget
psa	119:154	Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy
psa	119:155	Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy
psa	119:156	Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to
psa	119:157	Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline
psa	119:158	I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept
psa	119:159	Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD,
psa	119:160	Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy
psa	119:161	Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart
psa	119:162	I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.
psa	119:163	I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love.
psa	119:164	Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous
psa	119:165	Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall
psa	119:166	LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy
psa	119:167	My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them
psa	119:168	I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways
psa	119:169	Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me
psa	119:170	Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to
psa	119:171	My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy
psa	119:172	My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments
psa	119:173	Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts.
psa	119:174	I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law is my
psa	119:175	Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy
psa	119:176	I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I
psa	120:1	In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me.
psa	120:2	Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful
psa	120:3	What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee,
psa	120:4	Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.
psa	120:5	Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents
psa	120:6	My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.
psa	120:7	I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.
psa	121:1	I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my
psa	121:2	My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth.
psa	121:3	He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee
psa	121:4	Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.
psa	121:5	The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right
psa	121:6	The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.
psa	121:7	The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve
psa	121:8	The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from
psa	122:1	I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of
psa	122:2	Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.
psa	122:3	Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:
psa	122:4	Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the
psa	122:5	For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house
psa	122:6	Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love
psa	122:7	Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.
psa	122:8	For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say, Peace be
psa	122:9	Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.
psa	123:1	Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the
psa	123:2	Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their
psa	123:3	Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are
psa	123:4	Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that
psa	124:1	If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel
psa	124:2	If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose
psa	124:3	Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was
psa	124:4	Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our
psa	124:5	Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.
psa	124:6	Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their
psa	124:7	Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers:
psa	124:8	Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.
psa	125:1	They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which cannot
psa	125:2	As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round
psa	125:3	For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the
psa	125:4	Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that are
psa	125:5	As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD
psa	126:1	When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like
psa	126:2	Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with
psa	126:3	The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.
psa	126:4	Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.
psa	126:5	They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
psa	126:6	He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall
psa	127:1	Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build
psa	127:2	It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the
psa	127:3	Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the
psa	127:4	As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of
psa	127:5	Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall
psa	128:1	Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his
psa	128:2	For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou

ecc	1:2	Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is
ecc	1:3	What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the
ecc	1:5	The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his
ecc	1:6	The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north;
ecc	1:7	All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the
ecc	1:8	All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not
ecc	1:9	The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that
ecc	1:10	Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it
ecc	1:11	There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be
ecc	1:12	I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
ecc	1:13	And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning
ecc	1:14	I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and,
ecc	1:15	That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is
ecc	1:16	I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great
ecc	1:17	And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and
ecc	1:18	For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth
ecc	2:1	I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth,
ecc	2:2	I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it? 2:3 I
ecc	2:4	I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me
ecc	2:9	So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in
ecc	2:10	And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld
ecc	2:11	Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on
ecc	2:12	And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for
ecc	2:13	Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth
ecc	2:14	The wise man’s eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in
ecc	2:15	Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it
ecc	2:16	For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for
ecc	2:17	Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under
ecc	2:18	Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun:
ecc	2:19	And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet
ecc	2:20	Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the
ecc	2:21	For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge,
ecc	2:22	For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his
ecc	2:24	There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and
ecc	2:25	For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?
ecc	2:26	For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and
ecc	3:1	To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose
ecc	3:9	What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?
ecc	3:10	I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men
ecc	3:11	He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set
ecc	3:12	I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice,
ecc	3:13	And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good
ecc	3:14	I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing
ecc	3:15	That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already
ecc	3:16	And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that
ecc	3:17	I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the
ecc	3:18	I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men,
ecc	3:19	For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even
ecc	3:20	All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust
ecc	3:21	Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit
ecc	4:2	Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the

ecc	4:4	Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for

ecc	4:6	Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with

ecc	4:13	Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king,
ecc	4:14	For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is

ecc	5:1	Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more
ecc	5:2	Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to
ecc	5:3	For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool’s
ecc	5:4	When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath
ecc	5:5	Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest
ecc	5:6	Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou
ecc	5:8	If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting
ecc	5:9	Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is
ecc	5:10	He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he
ecc	5:11	When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what
ecc	5:13	There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely,
ecc	5:14	But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son,
ecc	5:15	As he came forth of his mother’s womb, naked shall he return to
ecc	5:16	And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so
ecc	5:17	All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much sorrow
ecc	5:18	Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one to
ecc	5:19	Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath
ecc	5:20	For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God
ecc	6:1	There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common
ecc	6:3	If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so that
ecc	6:4	For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his
ecc	6:5	Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this hath
ecc	6:6	Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he seen
ecc	6:8	For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor,
ecc	6:10	That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it is
ecc	6:11	Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man the
ecc	7:2	It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the
ecc	7:3	Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the
ecc	7:4	The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart
ecc	7:5	It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to
ecc	7:6	For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of
ecc	7:7	Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the
ecc	7:8	Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the
ecc	7:9	Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the
ecc	7:10	Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better
ecc	7:11	Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to
ecc	7:12	For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the
ecc	7:13	Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which
ecc	7:15	All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just
ecc	7:16	Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why
ecc	7:19	Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are
ecc	7:20	For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and
ecc	7:21	Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear
ecc	7:23	All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it
ecc	7:24	That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?
ecc	7:25	I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out
ecc	7:27	Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by
ecc	7:29	Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but
ecc	8:1	Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a
ecc	8:2	I counsel thee to keep the king’s commandment, and that in regard
ecc	8:3	Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing;
ecc	8:4	Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto
ecc	8:6	Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the
ecc	8:7	For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when
ecc	8:9	All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is
ecc	8:10	And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the

ecc	9:10	Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for
ecc	9:11	I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the
ecc	9:12	For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken
ecc	9:13	This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great
ecc	9:16	Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the

ecc	10:12	The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious; but the lips of a
ecc	10:13	The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the
ecc	10:14	A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be;
ecc	10:16	Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes
ecc	10:19	A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money
ecc	10:20	Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the
ecc	11:1	Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many

ecc	11:5	As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the

ecc	11:9	Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee
ecc	11:10	Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from

ecc	12:7	Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit
ecc	12:8	Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.
ecc	12:9	And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the
ecc	12:10	The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that which
ecc	12:11	The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the

isa	1:9	Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we
isa	1:10	Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the
isa	1:11	To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me?
isa	1:12	When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your
isa	1:14	Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are
isa	1:15	And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from
isa	1:16	Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from
isa	1:18	Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your
isa	1:19	If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:
isa	1:20	But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword:
isa	1:21	How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of
isa	1:22	Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water: 1:23 Thy
isa	1:24	Therefore saith the LORD, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of
isa	1:27	Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with
isa	1:28	And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall

isa	2:1	The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and
isa	2:2	And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of

isa	2:22	Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein
isa	3:2	The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet,

isa	5:18	Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as
isa	5:25	Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people,
isa	5:26	And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will
isa	5:30	And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of
isa	6:1	In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting upon

isa	6:3	And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the

isa	6:9	And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but
isa	6:10	Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and
isa	6:11	Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be

isa	7:1	And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son
isa	7:2	And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate
isa	7:3	Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou,
isa	7:5	Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil
isa	7:8	For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is
isa	7:9	And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is
isa	7:10	Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying, 7:11 Ask thee a
isa	7:12	But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.
isa	7:13	And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing
isa	7:15	Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the
isa	7:16	For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose
isa	7:17	The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy
isa	7:18	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall hiss
isa	7:19	And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate
isa	7:20	In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired,
isa	7:21	And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a
isa	7:23	And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall be,
isa	7:24	With arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all the
isa	7:25	And on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there

isa	8:2	And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest,
isa	8:3	And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son.
isa	8:4	For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and
isa	8:5	The LORD spake also unto me again, saying, 8:6 Forasmuch as this

isa	8:11	For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed
isa	8:13	Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and
isa	8:14	And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and
isa	8:15	And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and
isa	8:16	Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.
isa	8:17	And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the
isa	8:18	Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for
isa	8:19	And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have
isa	8:21	And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it
isa	8:22	And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and
isa	9:1	Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation,
isa	9:2	The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they
isa	9:3	Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy: they
isa	9:4	For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his
isa	9:5	For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and
isa	9:6	For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the
isa	9:7	Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end,
isa	9:8	The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel.
isa	9:9	And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of
isa	9:11	Therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against
isa	9:13	For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do
isa	9:14	Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch
isa	9:15	The ancient and honourable, he is the head; and the prophet that
isa	9:16	For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they that
isa	9:17	Therefore the LORD shall have no joy in their young men, neither
isa	9:18	For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers
isa	9:19	Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and
isa	9:20	And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he
isa	10:1	Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write
isa	10:3	And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the
isa	10:5	O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is
isa	10:6	I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the
isa	10:7	Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but
isa	10:8	For he saith, Are not my princes altogether kings? 10:9 Is not
isa	10:13	For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by
isa	10:15	Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? or
isa	10:16	Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat
isa	10:17	And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One
isa	10:19	And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a
isa	10:20	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of
isa	10:21	The remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the
isa	10:22	For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a
isa	10:23	For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even
isa	10:24	Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that
isa	10:25	For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease,
isa	10:26	And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according
isa	10:27	And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be
isa	10:28	He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath
isa	10:30	Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard
isa	10:31	Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves
isa	10:32	As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his hand
isa	10:33	Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with
isa	10:34	And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and
isa	11:1	And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a
isa	11:5	And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and
isa	11:6	The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall
isa	11:7	And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie
isa	11:8	And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the
isa	11:9	They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the
isa	11:10	And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall
isa	11:11	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set
isa	11:12	And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall
isa	11:13	The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of
isa	11:14	But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward
isa	11:15	And the LORD shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian
isa	11:16	And there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people,
isa	12:1	And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee:
isa	12:2	Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for
isa	12:3	Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of
isa	12:4	And in that day shall ye say, Praise the LORD, call upon his
isa	12:5	Sing unto the LORD; for he hath done excellent things: this is
isa	12:6	Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy
isa	13:1	The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.
isa	13:2	Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto
isa	13:3	I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty
isa	13:4	The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great
isa	13:5	They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even the
isa	13:6	Howl ye; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as a
isa	13:7	Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man’s heart shall
isa	13:9	Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and
isa	13:10	For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not
isa	13:11	And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for
isa	13:12	I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than
isa	13:13	Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove
isa	13:14	And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man
isa	13:15	Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one
isa	13:16	Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes;
isa	13:17	Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not
isa	13:18	Their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they
isa	13:19	And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees’
isa	13:20	It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from
isa	13:21	But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses
isa	13:22	And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate
isa	14:1	For the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose
isa	14:2	And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place:
isa	14:3	And it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give
isa	14:6	He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that
isa	14:7	The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into
isa	14:8	Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon,
isa	14:9	Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming:
isa	14:10	All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become
isa	14:12	How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!
isa	14:13	For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I
isa	14:15	Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.
isa	14:16	They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider
isa	14:19	But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch,
isa	14:20	Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast
isa	14:21	Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their
isa	14:22	For I will rise up against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and
isa	14:23	I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of
isa	14:24	The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought,
isa	14:25	That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains
isa	14:26	This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and
isa	14:27	For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it?
isa	14:29	Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that
isa	14:30	And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall
isa	14:31	Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, art dissolved:
isa	14:32	What shall one then answer the messengers of the nation? That
isa	15:1	The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid
isa	15:3	In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on
isa	15:4	And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh: their voice shall be heard
isa	15:5	My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall flee unto
isa	15:6	For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate: for the hay is
isa	15:7	Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they
isa	15:8	For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the howling
isa	15:9	For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood: for I will bring
isa	16:1	Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the
isa	16:2	For it shall be, that, as a wandering bird cast out of the nest,
isa	16:3	Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in
isa	16:4	Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them
isa	16:5	And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit
isa	16:6	We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud: even of his
isa	16:7	Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the
isa	16:8	For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah: the
isa	16:9	Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of
isa	16:10	And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field;
isa	16:11	Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and mine
isa	16:12	And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on
isa	16:13	This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab since
isa	16:14	But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the
isa	17:1	The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from being
isa	17:2	The cities of Aroer are forsaken: they shall be for flocks, which
isa	17:3	The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from
isa	17:4	And in that day it shall come to pass, that the glory of Jacob
isa	17:5	And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn, and
isa	17:6	Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an
isa	17:7	At that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall
isa	17:8	And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands,
isa	17:9	In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough, and
isa	17:10	Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast
isa	17:12	Woe to the multitude of many people, which make a noise like the
isa	17:14	And behold at eveningtide trouble; and before the morning he is
isa	18:1	Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which is beyond the rivers
isa	18:4	For so the LORD said unto me, I will take my rest, and I will
isa	18:5	For afore the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour
isa	18:6	They shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains, and
isa	18:7	In that time shall the present be brought unto the LORD of hosts
isa	19:1	The burden of Egypt. Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift cloud,
isa	19:2	And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they
isa	19:3	And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and I
isa	19:4	And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord;
isa	19:5	And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be
isa	19:6	And they shall turn the rivers far away; and the brooks of
isa	19:7	The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and
isa	19:8	The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle into
isa	19:9	Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave
isa	19:10	And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that make
isa	19:11	Surely the princes of Zoan are fools, the counsel of the wise
isa	19:13	The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are
isa	19:14	The LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof:
isa	19:15	Neither shall there be any work for Egypt, which the head or
isa	19:16	In that day shall Egypt be like unto women: and it shall be
isa	19:17	And the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt, every one
isa	19:18	In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the
isa	19:19	In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst of
isa	19:20	And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the LORD of
isa	19:21	And the LORD shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall
isa	19:22	And the LORD shall smite Egypt: he shall smite and heal it: and
isa	19:23	In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria,
isa	19:24	In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with
isa	20:1	In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod, (when Sargon the king
isa	20:3	And the LORD said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked
isa	20:5	And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their
isa	20:6	And the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day, Behold,
isa	21:2	A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer
isa	21:3	Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold
isa	21:4	My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my
isa	21:5	Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye
isa	21:6	For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him
isa	21:7	And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of
isa	21:10	O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have
isa	21:11	The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman,
isa	21:13	The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge,
isa	21:14	The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that
isa	21:15	For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from
isa	21:16	For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Within a year, according to
isa	22:1	The burden of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now, that
isa	22:3	All thy rulers are fled together, they are bound by the archers:
isa	22:4	Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly, labour
isa	22:5	For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of
isa	22:6	And Elam bare the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen, and
isa	22:7	And it shall come to pass, that thy choicest valleys shall be
isa	22:8	And he discovered the covering of Judah, and thou didst look in
isa	22:9	Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David, that they
isa	22:10	And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses
isa	22:11	Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the
isa	22:12	And in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call to weeping, and
isa	22:14	And it was revealed in mine ears by the LORD of hosts, Surely
isa	22:15	Thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, Go, get thee unto this
isa	22:18	He will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a
isa	22:19	And I will drive thee from thy station, and from thy state shall
isa	22:20	And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my
isa	22:22	And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder;
isa	22:23	And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be
isa	22:24	And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father’s
isa	22:25	In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall the nail that is
isa	23:1	The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid
isa	23:2	Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants of
isa	23:3	And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river,
isa	23:4	Be thou ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea hath spoken, even the
isa	23:5	As at the report concerning Egypt, so shall they be sorely pained
isa	23:6	Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle.
isa	23:7	Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days? her
isa	23:8	Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city,
isa	23:10	Pass through thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish: there
isa	23:11	He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms:
isa	23:12	And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed
isa	23:13	Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, till the
isa	23:14	Howl, ye ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste.
isa	23:15	And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be
isa	23:16	Take an harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been
isa	23:17	And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that
isa	23:18	And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the LORD:
isa	24:1	Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and
isa	24:2	And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with
isa	24:3	The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the
isa	24:4	The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and
isa	24:5	The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because
isa	24:6	Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell
isa	24:7	The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merryhearted
isa	24:8	The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice
isa	24:9	They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be
isa	24:10	The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up,
isa	24:11	There is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened,
isa	24:12	In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with
isa	24:13	When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people,
isa	24:14	They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty
isa	24:15	Wherefore glorify ye the LORD in the fires, even the name of the
isa	24:16	From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, even
isa	24:17	Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of
isa	24:18	And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of
isa	24:19	The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved,
isa	24:20	The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be
isa	24:21	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall
isa	24:22	And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered
isa	24:23	Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the
isa	25:1	O Lord, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy
isa	25:2	For thou hast made of a city an heap; of a defenced city a ruin:
isa	25:3	Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the
isa	25:4	For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the
isa	25:5	Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a
isa	25:6	And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people
isa	25:7	And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering
isa	25:8	He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe
isa	25:9	And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have
isa	25:10	For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab
isa	25:11	And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he
isa	25:12	And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring
isa	26:1	In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have
isa	26:2	Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the
isa	26:3	Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on
isa	26:4	Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH is
isa	26:6	The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and the
isa	26:7	The way of the just is uprightness: thou, most upright, dost
isa	26:8	Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for
isa	26:9	With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my
isa	26:10	Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn
isa	26:11	LORD, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: but they
isa	26:12	LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought
isa	26:13	O LORD our God, other lords beside thee have had dominion over
isa	26:14	They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they
isa	26:15	Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the
isa	26:16	LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a
isa	26:17	Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her
isa	26:18	We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it
isa	26:19	Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they
isa	26:20	Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy
isa	26:21	For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the
isa	27:1	In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword
isa	27:2	In that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine.
isa	27:3	I the LORD do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest any
isa	27:4	Fury is not in me: who would set the briers and thorns against me
isa	27:5	Or let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with
isa	27:6	He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root: Israel shall
isa	27:7	Hath he smitten him, as he smote those that smote him? or is he
isa	27:9	By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this
isa	27:10	Yet the defenced city shall be desolate, and the habitation
isa	27:11	When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken off:
isa	27:12	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall beat
isa	27:13	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the great trumpet
isa	28:1	Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose
isa	28:3	The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden
isa	28:5	In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory, and
isa	28:7	But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink
isa	28:8	For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is
isa	28:9	Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to
isa	28:10	For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line
isa	28:12	To whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the
isa	28:13	But the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept,
isa	28:14	Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, that rule
isa	28:15	Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and
isa	28:17	Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the
isa	28:18	And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your
isa	28:19	From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for morning
isa	28:20	For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on
isa	28:21	For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be
isa	28:22	Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong:
isa	28:23	Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.
isa	28:24	Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break the
isa	28:27	For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument,
isa	28:28	Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing it,
isa	28:29	This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts, which is
isa	29:1	Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! add ye year
isa	29:2	Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and
isa	29:3	And I will camp against thee round about, and will lay siege
isa	29:4	And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the
isa	29:5	Moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust,
isa	29:6	Thou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with
isa	29:7	And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel,
isa	29:8	It shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he
isa	29:9	Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are
isa	29:10	For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep,
isa	29:11	And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book
isa	29:13	Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me
isa	29:15	Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the
isa	29:19	The meek also shall increase their joy in the LORD, and the poor
isa	29:20	For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is
isa	29:22	Therefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning
isa	29:23	But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the
isa	29:24	They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and
isa	30:1	Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take
isa	30:4	For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes.
isa	30:5	They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them, nor
isa	30:6	The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble
isa	30:7	For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose:
isa	30:8	Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book,
isa	30:12	Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise
isa	30:13	Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to
isa	30:14	And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters’ vessel
isa	30:15	For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In
isa	30:16	But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall
isa	30:17	One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of
isa	30:18	And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto
isa	30:19	For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt weep
isa	30:20	And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the
isa	30:22	Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of
isa	30:23	Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the
isa	30:24	The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall
isa	30:25	And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high
isa	30:26	Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun,
isa	30:27	Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning with his
isa	30:29	Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is
isa	30:30	And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and
isa	30:31	For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten
isa	30:32	And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which
isa	30:33	For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared;
isa	31:1	Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses,
isa	31:3	Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh,
isa	31:4	For thus hath the LORD spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the
isa	31:5	As birds flying, so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem;
isa	31:6	Turn ye unto him from whom the children of Israel have deeply
isa	31:7	For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver,
isa	31:8	Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty man;
isa	31:9	And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his
isa	32:1	Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall
isa	32:2	And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert
isa	32:3	And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of
isa	32:4	The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the
isa	32:5	The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl
isa	32:6	For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will work
isa	32:7	The instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked
isa	32:8	But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things
isa	32:9	Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless
isa	32:10	Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women: for
isa	32:11	Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless
isa	32:12	They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for
isa	32:13	Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; yea,
isa	32:16	Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness
isa	32:17	And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of
isa	32:18	And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure
isa	32:20	Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth
isa	33:1	Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest
isa	33:2	O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou
isa	33:3	At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of
isa	33:4	And your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the
isa	33:5	The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion
isa	33:6	And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, and
isa	33:7	Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of
isa	33:8	The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken
isa	33:9	The earth mourneth and languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed and hewn
isa	33:10	Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will
isa	33:11	Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your
isa	33:12	And the people shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut
isa	33:13	Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are
isa	33:14	The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the
isa	33:17	Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold
isa	33:18	Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where is the scribe? where is
isa	33:20	Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall
isa	33:21	But there the glorious LORD will be unto us a place of broad
isa	33:22	For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is
isa	33:23	Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their
isa	33:24	And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that
isa	34:1	Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let the
isa	34:2	For the indignation of the LORD is upon all nations, and his fury
isa	34:3	Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up
isa	34:4	And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens
isa	34:5	For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come
isa	34:6	The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with
isa	34:7	And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with
isa	34:8	For it is the day of the LORD’s vengeance, and the year of
isa	34:9	And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust
isa	34:10	It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall
isa	34:11	But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also
isa	34:12	They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none
isa	34:13	And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in
isa	34:14	The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild
isa	34:15	There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and
isa	34:16	Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these
isa	34:17	And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it
isa	35:1	The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and
isa	35:2	It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and
isa	35:3	Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.
isa	35:4	Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not:
isa	35:5	Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the
isa	35:6	Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the
isa	35:7	And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land
isa	35:8	And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called
isa	35:9	No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up
isa	36:1	Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that
isa	36:2	And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem
isa	36:3	Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah’s son, which was over
isa	36:4	And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith
isa	36:7	But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is it not
isa	36:8	Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of
isa	36:9	How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least
isa	36:11	Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I
isa	36:12	But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to
isa	36:14	Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall
isa	36:15	Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The
isa	36:16	Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria,
isa	36:18	Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, the LORD will deliver
isa	36:22	Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the
isa	37:1	And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent
isa	37:2	And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the
isa	37:3	And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of
isa	37:4	It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom
isa	37:5	So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
isa	37:6	And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master,
isa	37:7	Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour,
isa	37:8	So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring
isa	37:9	And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come
isa	37:11	Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to
isa	37:12	Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers
isa	37:15	And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying, 37:16 O LORD of
isa	37:17	Incline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD,
isa	37:18	Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the
isa	37:20	Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all
isa	37:21	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus
isa	37:23	Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast
isa	37:24	By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By
isa	37:25	I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet
isa	37:26	Hast thou not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of ancient
isa	37:27	Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were
isa	37:28	But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and
isa	37:29	Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into
isa	37:30	And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such
isa	37:31	And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall
isa	37:33	Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He
isa	37:34	By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall
isa	37:35	For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and
isa	37:36	Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of
isa	37:37	So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned,
isa	37:38	And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of
isa	38:1	In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the
isa	38:2	Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto
isa	38:4	Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying, 38:5 Go, and
isa	38:6	And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king
isa	38:7	And this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD
isa	38:9	The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and
isa	38:11	I said, I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land of
isa	38:12	Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd’s
isa	38:13	I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all
isa	38:14	Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a
isa	38:15	What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath
isa	38:16	O LORD, by these things men live, and in all these things is the
isa	38:17	Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love
isa	38:18	For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee:
isa	38:19	The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day:
isa	38:20	The LORD was ready to save me: therefore we will sing my songs
isa	38:21	For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it
isa	38:22	Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to
isa	39:2	And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of his
isa	39:3	Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto
isa	39:4	Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah
isa	39:5	Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:
isa	39:6	Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that
isa	39:7	And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt
isa	39:8	Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which
isa	40:1	Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.
isa	40:2	Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her
isa	40:3	The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the
isa	40:4	Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall
isa	40:6	The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is
isa	40:7	The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the
isa	40:8	The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God
isa	40:9	O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high
isa	40:11	He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the
isa	40:12	Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and
isa	40:16	And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof
isa	40:17	All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to
isa	40:18	To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare
isa	40:20	He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a
isa	40:21	Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you
isa	40:23	That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of
isa	40:24	Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown:
isa	40:25	To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the
isa	40:26	Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these
isa	40:27	Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid
isa	40:29	He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he
isa	40:30	Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men
isa	41:1	Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the people renew their
isa	41:2	Who raised up the righteous man from the east, called him to his
isa	41:3	He pursued them, and passed safely; even by the way that he had
isa	41:4	Who hath wrought and done it, calling the generations from the
isa	41:5	The isles saw it, and feared; the ends of the earth were afraid,
isa	41:6	They helped every one his neighbour; and every one said to his
isa	41:7	So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that smootheth
isa	41:8	But thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the
isa	41:9	Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called
isa	41:10	Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy
isa	41:11	Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be
isa	41:12	Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even them that
isa	41:13	For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto
isa	41:14	Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I will help
isa	41:15	Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having
isa	41:16	Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the
isa	41:17	When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their
isa	41:18	I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of
isa	41:19	I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and
isa	41:21	Produce your cause, saith the LORD; bring forth your strong
isa	41:22	Let them bring them forth, and shew us what shall happen: let
isa	41:23	Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know
isa	41:24	Behold, ye are of nothing, and your work of nought: an
isa	41:25	I have raised up one from the north, and he shall come: from the
isa	41:26	Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? and
isa	41:27	The first shall say to Zion, Behold, behold them: and I will
isa	41:28	For I beheld, and there was no man; even among them, and there
isa	41:29	Behold, they are all vanity; their works are nothing: their
isa	42:1	Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul
isa	42:2	He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in
isa	42:3	A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he
isa	42:4	He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment
isa	42:5	Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and
isa	42:8	I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to
isa	42:9	Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I
isa	42:10	Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise from the end of
isa	42:11	Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice,
isa	42:12	Let them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in the
isa	42:13	The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up
isa	42:14	I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and
isa	42:15	I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their
isa	42:16	And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will
isa	42:17	They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that
isa	42:18	Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.
isa	42:19	Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I
isa	42:21	The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness’ sake; he will
isa	42:22	But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them
isa	42:23	Who among you will give ear to this? who will hearken and hear
isa	42:25	Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the
isa	43:1	But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he
isa	43:2	When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and
isa	43:3	For I am the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I
isa	43:4	Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable,
isa	43:5	Fear not: for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the
isa	43:8	Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that
isa	43:9	Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be
isa	43:10	Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have
isa	43:11	I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no saviour.
isa	43:12	I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there
isa	43:13	Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can
isa	43:15	I am the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King.
isa	43:16	Thus saith the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path
isa	43:18	Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things
isa	43:19	Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall
isa	43:20	The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the
isa	43:21	This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my
isa	43:22	But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been
isa	43:23	Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt
isa	43:24	Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou
isa	43:25	I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine
isa	43:26	Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that
isa	43:27	Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed
isa	43:28	Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have
isa	44:1	Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen:
isa	44:2	Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the
isa	44:3	For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon
isa	44:5	One shall say, I am the LORD’s; and another shall call himself by
isa	44:6	Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD
isa	44:7	And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in
isa	44:8	Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that
isa	44:9	They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their
isa	44:10	Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image that is
isa	44:12	The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and
isa	44:13	The carpenter stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with a
isa	44:14	He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak,
isa	44:15	Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof,
isa	44:16	He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth
isa	44:18	They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their eyes,
isa	44:19	And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge
isa	44:22	I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and,
isa	44:23	Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done it: shout, ye lower
isa	44:24	Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from
isa	44:26	That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the
isa	45:1	Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I
isa	45:4	For Jacob my servant’s sake, and Israel mine elect, I have even
isa	45:5	I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside me:
isa	45:7	I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create
isa	45:8	Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down
isa	45:9	Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let the potsherd
isa	45:12	I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my
isa	45:13	I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his
isa	45:14	Thus saith the LORD, The labour of Egypt, and merchandise of
isa	45:15	Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the
isa	45:16	They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they
isa	45:17	But Israel shall be saved in the LORD with an everlasting
isa	45:18	For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself
isa	45:19	I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I
isa	45:20	Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are
isa	45:21	Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel
isa	45:22	Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I
isa	45:23	I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in
isa	45:24	Surely, shall one say, in the LORD have I righteousness and
isa	45:25	In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall
isa	46:1	Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon the beasts,
isa	46:2	They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the
isa	46:3	Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the
isa	46:5	To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that
isa	46:7	They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in
isa	46:8	Remember this, and shew yourselves men: bring it again to mind, O
isa	46:9	Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is
isa	46:12	Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that are far from
isa	47:1	Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit
isa	47:2	Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make bare
isa	47:3	Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I
isa	47:4	As for our redeemer, the LORD of hosts is his name, the Holy One
isa	47:5	Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the
isa	47:6	I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and
isa	47:7	And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: so that thou didst
isa	47:8	Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to pleasures, that
isa	47:10	For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None
isa	47:11	Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from
isa	47:12	Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy
isa	47:13	Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the
isa	47:14	Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they
isa	47:15	Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured, even
isa	48:1	Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of
isa	48:2	For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves
isa	48:3	I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they
isa	48:4	Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron
isa	48:6	Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare it? I have
isa	48:7	They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the
isa	48:8	Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that
isa	48:9	For my name’s sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise
isa	48:10	Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen
isa	48:11	For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for how
isa	48:12	Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am
isa	48:13	Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my
isa	48:14	All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath
isa	48:15	I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought
isa	48:16	Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret
isa	48:17	Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am
isa	48:18	O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy
isa	48:19	Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy
isa	48:20	Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice
isa	48:21	And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he
isa	48:22	There is no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked.
isa	49:1	Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far; The
isa	49:2	And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of
isa	49:4	Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength
isa	49:5	And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his
isa	49:6	And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my
isa	49:7	Thus saith the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to
isa	49:8	Thus saith the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and
isa	49:10	They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun
isa	49:11	And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be
isa	49:12	Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north
isa	49:13	Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into
isa	49:14	But Zion said, The LORD hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath
isa	49:15	Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have
isa	49:16	Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls
isa	49:17	Thy children shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that made
isa	49:18	Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather
isa	49:19	For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy
isa	49:20	The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the
isa	49:21	Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these,
isa	49:23	And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy
isa	49:24	Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive
isa	49:26	And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and
isa	50:1	Thus saith the LORD, Where is the bill of your mother’s
isa	50:2	Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was
isa	50:3	I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their
isa	50:4	The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I
isa	50:5	The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious,
isa	50:6	I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked
isa	50:7	For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be
isa	50:8	He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us
isa	50:9	Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that shall condemn
isa	50:10	Who is among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice
isa	50:11	Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about
isa	51:1	Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek
isa	51:2	Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you: for
isa	51:3	For the LORD shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste
isa	51:4	Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation:
isa	51:5	My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine
isa	51:6	Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth
isa	51:7	Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose
isa	51:8	For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall
isa	51:9	Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in
isa	51:12	I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou
isa	51:15	But I am the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves
isa	51:16	And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in
isa	51:17	Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the
isa	51:18	There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath
isa	51:19	These two things are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for
isa	51:21	Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not
isa	52:1	Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful
isa	52:2	Shake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem:
isa	52:3	For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and
isa	52:4	For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime into
isa	52:5	Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people
isa	52:6	Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall know
isa	52:7	How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that
isa	52:9	Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of
isa	52:10	The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the
isa	52:11	Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean
isa	52:12	For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the
isa	52:13	Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and
isa	52:14	As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more
isa	53:1	Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD
isa	53:3	He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and
isa	53:4	Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we
isa	53:5	But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our
isa	53:6	All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to
isa	53:7	He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his
isa	53:8	He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare
isa	53:9	And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his
isa	53:10	Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief:
isa	53:11	He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied:
isa	53:12	Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he
isa	54:1	Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into
isa	54:2	Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the
isa	54:4	Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou
isa	54:5	For thy Maker is thine husband; the LORD of hosts is his name;
isa	54:6	For the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in
isa	54:7	For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies
isa	54:8	In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with
isa	54:9	For this is as the waters of Noah unto me: for as I have sworn
isa	54:10	For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my
isa	54:11	O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted,
isa	54:12	And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of
isa	54:13	And all thy children shall be taught of the LORD; and great
isa	54:14	In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far
isa	54:15	Behold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me:
isa	54:16	Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the
isa	54:17	No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every
isa	55:1	Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that
isa	55:2	Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your
isa	55:3	Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall
isa	55:4	Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader
isa	55:5	Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and
isa	55:6	Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he
isa	55:8	For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my
isa	55:9	For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways
isa	55:10	For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and
isa	55:12	For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the
isa	55:13	Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of
isa	56:1	Thus saith the LORD, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my
isa	56:2	Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that
isa	56:3	Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to
isa	56:4	For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths,
isa	56:5	Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a
isa	56:6	Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD,
isa	56:8	The Lord GOD, which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet
isa	56:9	All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, yea, all ye beasts in
isa	56:10	His watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all dumb
isa	56:11	Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they
isa	56:12	Come ye, say they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves
isa	57:1	The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart: and
isa	57:2	He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, each
isa	57:3	But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the
isa	57:4	Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide
isa	57:5	Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying
isa	57:8	Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy
isa	57:9	And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase
isa	57:10	Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; yet saidst thou
isa	57:11	And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast
isa	57:13	When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind
isa	57:15	For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity,
isa	57:16	For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth:
isa	57:17	For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him:
isa	57:18	I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also,
isa	57:19	I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is far
isa	57:20	But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest,
isa	57:21	There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.
isa	58:1	Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew
isa	58:2	Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation
isa	58:3	Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore
isa	58:4	Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist
isa	58:5	Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict
isa	58:8	Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health
isa	58:9	Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry,
isa	58:12	And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places:
isa	58:13	If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy
isa	59:1	Behold, the LORD’s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save;
isa	59:3	For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with
isa	59:4	None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust
isa	59:5	They hatch cockatrice’ eggs, and weave the spider’s web: he that
isa	59:6	Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover
isa	59:7	Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent
isa	59:8	The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in their
isa	59:9	Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake
isa	59:10	We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had
isa	59:11	We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for
isa	59:12	For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins
isa	59:14	And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar
isa	59:15	Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh
isa	59:16	And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no
isa	59:17	For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of
isa	59:18	According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his
isa	59:19	So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his
isa	59:20	And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn
isa	59:21	As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My
isa	60:1	Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is
isa	60:2	For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross
isa	60:3	And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the
isa	60:4	Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all they gather
isa	60:5	Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thine heart shall
isa	60:6	The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of
isa	60:7	All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the
isa	60:8	Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their
isa	60:10	And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their
isa	60:11	Therefore thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not be
isa	60:12	For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall
isa	60:13	The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the
isa	60:14	The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending
isa	60:15	Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man went
isa	60:16	Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck
isa	60:17	For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver,
isa	60:18	Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor
isa	60:19	The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for
isa	60:20	Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw
isa	60:21	Thy people also shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the
isa	60:22	A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong
isa	61:1	The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath
isa	61:4	And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the
isa	61:5	And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of
isa	61:6	But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD: men shall call you
isa	61:7	For your shame ye shall have double; and for confusion they shall
isa	61:8	For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering;
isa	61:9	And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their
isa	61:10	I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in
isa	61:11	For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden
isa	62:1	For Zion’s sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem’s
isa	62:2	And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy
isa	62:3	Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and
isa	62:4	Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any
isa	62:5	For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry
isa	62:6	I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which shall
isa	62:8	The LORD hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his
isa	62:10	Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the
isa	62:11	Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the world, Say
isa	62:12	And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the
isa	63:1	Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from
isa	63:2	Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like
isa	63:4	For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my
isa	63:5	And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that
isa	63:6	And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them
isa	63:7	I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, and the praises
isa	63:8	For he said, Surely they are my people, children that will not
isa	63:9	In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his
isa	63:10	But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was
isa	63:11	Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people,
isa	63:15	Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy
isa	63:17	O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened
isa	63:18	The people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while:
isa	63:19	We are thine: thou never barest rule over them; they were not
isa	64:1	Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come
isa	64:4	For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor
isa	64:5	Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those
isa	64:6	But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses
isa	64:7	And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up
isa	64:8	But now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou
isa	64:9	Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for
isa	64:10	Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness,
isa	64:11	Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised
isa	64:12	Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O LORD? wilt thou
isa	65:2	I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people,
isa	65:3	A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that
isa	65:5	Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier
isa	65:6	Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but
isa	65:8	Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and
isa	65:9	And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an
isa	65:10	And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a
isa	65:11	But ye are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy
isa	65:12	Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow
isa	65:13	Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall
isa	65:15	And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the
isa	65:17	For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the
isa	65:18	But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for,
isa	65:19	And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the
isa	65:20	There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man
isa	65:21	And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall
isa	65:22	They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant,
isa	65:23	They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for
isa	65:24	And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer;
isa	65:25	The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall
isa	66:1	Thus saith the LORD, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my
isa	66:3	He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth
isa	66:4	I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears
isa	66:5	Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word; Your
isa	66:6	A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice
isa	66:7	Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came,
isa	66:8	Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the
isa	66:9	Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith
isa	66:10	Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that
isa	66:12	For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like
isa	66:13	As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye
isa	66:14	And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones
isa	66:15	For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots
isa	66:16	For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh:
isa	66:17	They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the
isa	66:18	For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I
isa	66:19	And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that
isa	66:20	And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the
isa	66:21	And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites, saith
isa	66:22	For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make,
isa	66:23	And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another,
isa	66:24	And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men
jer	1:1	The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that
jer	1:3	It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of
jer	1:4	Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 1:5 Before I
jer	1:6	Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a
jer	1:7	But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt
jer	1:8	Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee,
jer	1:9	Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the
jer	1:10	See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the
jer	1:11	Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah,
jer	1:12	Then said the LORD unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will
jer	1:13	And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying,
jer	1:14	Then the LORD said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break
jer	1:15	For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the
jer	1:16	And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their
jer	1:17	Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them
jer	1:18	For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an
jer	1:19	And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail
jer	2:1	Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 2:2 Go and cry
jer	2:3	Israel was holiness unto the LORD, and the firstfruits of his
jer	2:4	Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the
jer	2:7	And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit
jer	2:8	The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the
jer	2:9	Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the LORD, and with your
jer	2:10	For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar,
jer	2:11	Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my
jer	2:12	Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be
jer	2:13	For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the
jer	2:14	Is Israel a servant? is he a homeborn slave? why is he spoiled?
jer	2:15	The young lions roared upon him, and yelled, and they made his
jer	2:16	Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of
jer	2:17	Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast
jer	2:20	For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands; and
jer	2:21	Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how
jer	2:23	How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after
jer	2:25	Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst:
jer	2:26	As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of
jer	2:27	Saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast
jer	2:28	But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise,
jer	2:29	Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against
jer	2:30	In vain have I smitten your children; they received no
jer	2:31	O generation, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been a
jer	2:33	Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also
jer	2:34	Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor
jer	2:35	Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall
jer	2:36	Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt
jer	2:37	Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine
jer	3:1	They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and
jer	3:2	Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou hast
jer	3:3	Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no
jer	3:4	Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou art the
jer	3:6	The LORD said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast
jer	3:7	And I said after she had done all these things, Turn thou unto me.
jer	3:8	And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel
jer	3:9	And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that
jer	3:10	And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned
jer	3:11	And the LORD said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath justified
jer	3:12	Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return,
jer	3:13	Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed
jer	3:14	Turn, O backsliding children, saith the LORD; for I am married
jer	3:16	And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased in
jer	3:17	At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD;
jer	3:18	In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of
jer	3:19	But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give
jer	3:20	Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so
jer	3:21	A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping and supplications
jer	3:22	Return, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your
jer	3:23	Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the
jer	3:24	For shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth;
jer	3:25	We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: for we
jer	4:1	If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the LORD, return unto me: and
jer	4:2	And thou shalt swear, The LORD liveth, in truth, in judgment, and
jer	4:3	For thus saith the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break
jer	4:4	Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of
jer	4:5	Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye
jer	4:6	Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will
jer	4:7	The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the
jer	4:8	For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce
jer	4:9	And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the LORD, that the
jer	4:10	Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast greatly deceived this
jer	4:11	At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A
jer	4:13	Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as
jer	4:14	O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest
jer	4:16	Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against
jer	4:17	As keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because
jer	4:18	Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this
jer	4:19	My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart
jer	4:20	Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is
jer	4:21	How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the
jer	4:23	I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and
jer	4:24	I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills
jer	4:25	I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the
jer	4:26	I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all
jer	4:27	For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate;
jer	4:28	For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black;
jer	4:29	The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and
jer	4:30	And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou
jer	4:31	For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the
jer	5:1	Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now,
jer	5:2	And though they say, The LORD liveth; surely they swear falsely.
jer	5:3	O LORD, are not thine eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken
jer	5:4	Therefore I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish: for
jer	5:5	I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for
jer	5:6	Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, and a wolf of
jer	5:7	How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me,
jer	5:8	They were as fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after
jer	5:9	Shall I not visit for these things? saith the LORD: and shall not
jer	5:11	For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very
jer	5:12	They have belied the LORD, and said, It is not he; neither shall
jer	5:14	Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because ye speak this
jer	5:15	Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel,
jer	5:16	Their quiver is as an open sepulchre, they are all mighty men.
jer	5:17	And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, which thy
jer	5:18	Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a
jer	5:19	And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the
jer	5:20	Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah,
jer	5:24	Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our
jer	5:25	Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have
jer	5:26	For among my people are found wicked men: they lay wait, as he
jer	5:27	As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit:
jer	5:28	They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of
jer	5:29	Shall I not visit for these things? saith the LORD: shall not my
jer	6:2	I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate
jer	6:3	The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall
jer	6:4	Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe
jer	6:5	Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.
jer	6:6	For thus hath the LORD of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast
jer	6:7	As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her
jer	6:8	Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee;
jer	6:9	Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall throughly glean the
jer	6:10	To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear?
jer	6:11	Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with
jer	6:12	And their houses shall be turned unto others, with their fields
jer	6:13	For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every
jer	6:14	They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people
jer	6:15	Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they
jer	6:16	Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for
jer	6:17	Also I set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of the
jer	6:18	Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is
jer	6:19	Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even
jer	6:20	To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the
jer	6:21	Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will lay stumblingblocks
jer	6:22	Thus saith the LORD, Behold, a people cometh from the north
jer	6:23	They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no
jer	6:24	We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish
jer	6:25	Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword
jer	6:26	O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow
jer	6:27	I have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people, that
jer	6:28	They are all grievous revolters, walking with slanders: they are
jer	6:29	The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the
jer	6:30	Reprobate silver shall men call them, because the LORD hath
jer	7:1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 7:2 Stand in
jer	7:3	Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways
jer	7:4	Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the LORD, The
jer	7:5	For if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye
jer	7:8	Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.
jer	7:9	Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and
jer	7:10	And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my
jer	7:12	But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my
jer	7:13	And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the LORD,
jer	7:15	And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your
jer	7:16	Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor
jer	7:17	Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the
jer	7:19	Do they provoke me to anger? saith the LORD: do they not provoke
jer	7:21	Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt
jer	7:22	For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day
jer	7:24	But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the
jer	7:25	Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of
jer	7:27	Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they
jer	7:28	But thou shalt say unto them, This is a nation that obeyeth not
jer	7:29	Cut off thine hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a
jer	7:30	For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the
jer	7:31	And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the
jer	7:32	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall
jer	7:33	And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of
jer	7:34	Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the
jer	8:1	At that time, saith the LORD, they shall bring out the bones of
jer	8:3	And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of
jer	8:4	Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; Shall they
jer	8:6	I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man repented
jer	8:7	Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the
jer	8:8	How do ye say, We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us?
jer	8:9	The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they
jer	8:11	For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people
jer	8:12	Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they
jer	8:13	I will surely consume them, saith the LORD: there shall be no
jer	8:14	Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into
jer	8:15	We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health,
jer	8:17	For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which
jer	8:18	When I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint in
jer	8:19	Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because
jer	8:21	For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black;
jer	8:22	Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why then
jer	9:3	And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies: but they are
jer	9:4	Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any
jer	9:5	And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak
jer	9:6	Thine habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they
jer	9:7	Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them,
jer	9:9	Shall I not visit them for these things? saith the LORD: shall not
jer	9:11	And I will make Jerusalem heaps, and a den of dragons; and I will
jer	9:12	Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and who is he to
jer	9:16	I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor
jer	9:17	Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the
jer	9:19	For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled!
jer	9:20	Yet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and let your ear
jer	9:21	For death is come up into our windows, and is entered into our
jer	9:22	Speak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcases of men shall fall
jer	9:23	Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom,
jer	9:25	Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all
jer	10:1	Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of
jer	10:3	For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree
jer	10:4	They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails
jer	10:5	They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs
jer	10:6	Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD; thou art
jer	10:7	Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it
jer	10:8	But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a
jer	10:9	Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from
jer	10:10	But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an
jer	10:11	Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the
jer	10:12	He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the
jer	10:13	When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in
jer	10:14	Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is
jer	10:15	They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their
jer	10:16	The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of
jer	10:17	Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the
jer	10:18	For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the
jer	10:19	Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous; but I said, Truly
jer	10:20	My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my
jer	10:21	For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the
jer	10:22	Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion
jer	10:23	O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not
jer	10:24	O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest
jer	10:25	Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon
jer	11:1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD saying, 11:2 Hear ye
jer	11:6	Then the LORD said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the
jer	11:7	For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I
jer	11:8	Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one
jer	11:9	And the LORD said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of
jer	11:10	They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers,
jer	11:11	Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon
jer	11:12	Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go,
jer	11:13	For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O
jer	11:14	Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry
jer	11:15	What hath my beloved to do in mine house, seeing she hath
jer	11:16	The LORD called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, and of
jer	11:17	For the LORD of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil
jer	11:18	And the LORD hath given me knowledge of it, and I know it: then
jer	11:19	But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter;
jer	11:20	But, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the
jer	11:21	Therefore thus saith the LORD of the men of Anathoth, that seek
jer	12:1	Righteous art thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee: yet let me
jer	12:2	Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow,
jer	12:3	But thou, O LORD, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine
jer	12:4	How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field
jer	12:5	If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee,
jer	12:7	I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have
jer	12:8	Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out
jer	12:9	Mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird, the birds round
jer	12:10	Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my
jer	12:11	They have made it desolate, and being desolate it mourneth unto
jer	12:12	The spoilers are come upon all high places through the
jer	12:13	They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put
jer	12:14	Thus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours, that touch
jer	12:15	And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I
jer	12:16	And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the
jer	12:17	But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy
jer	13:1	Thus saith the LORD unto me, Go and get thee a linen girdle, and
jer	13:2	So I got a girdle according to the word of the LORD, and put it
jer	13:3	And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying,
jer	13:4	Take the girdle that thou hast got, which is upon thy loins, and
jer	13:5	So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.
jer	13:6	And it came to pass after many days, that the LORD said unto me,
jer	13:7	Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from
jer	13:8	Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 13:9 Thus saith
jer	13:10	This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in
jer	13:11	For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I
jer	13:12	Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus saith the
jer	13:14	And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and
jer	13:15	Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the LORD hath spoken.
jer	13:16	Give glory to the LORD your God, before he cause darkness, and
jer	13:17	But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places
jer	13:18	Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down:
jer	13:19	The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open
jer	13:20	Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north:
jer	13:23	Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?
jer	13:24	Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away
jer	13:25	This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the
jer	13:26	Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy
jer	13:27	I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of
jer	14:2	Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black
jer	14:3	And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they
jer	14:4	Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth,
jer	14:5	Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook it, because
jer	14:6	And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up
jer	14:7	O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou it for
jer	14:8	O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble, why
jer	14:10	Thus saith the LORD unto this people, Thus have they loved to
jer	14:11	Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this people for their
jer	14:12	When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer
jer	14:13	Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them,
jer	14:14	Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my
jer	14:15	Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that
jer	14:16	And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the
jer	14:17	Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run
jer	14:18	If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the
jer	14:19	Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul lothed Zion? why
jer	14:21	Do not abhor us, for thy name’s sake, do not disgrace the throne
jer	14:22	Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause
jer	15:1	Then said the LORD unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before
jer	15:2	And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall
jer	15:3	And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the
jer	15:4	And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the
jer	15:5	For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall
jer	15:7	And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will
jer	15:8	Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I
jer	15:9	She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the
jer	15:10	Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife
jer	15:11	The LORD said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily
jer	15:12	Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel? 15:13 Thy
jer	15:14	And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land
jer	15:15	O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me
jer	15:16	Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto
jer	15:17	I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat
jer	15:18	Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth
jer	15:20	And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and
jer	15:21	And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I
jer	16:1	The word of the LORD came also unto me, saying, 16:2 Thou shalt
jer	16:3	For thus saith the LORD concerning the sons and concerning the
jer	16:5	For thus saith the LORD, Enter not into the house of mourning,
jer	16:6	Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall
jer	16:8	Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting, to sit with
jer	16:9	For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I
jer	16:10	And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew this people all
jer	16:11	Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have
jer	16:14	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall
jer	16:16	Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the LORD, and they
jer	16:17	For mine eyes are upon all their ways: they are not hid from my
jer	16:18	And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double;
jer	16:19	O LORD, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day
jer	16:20	Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods? 16:21
jer	17:1	The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the
jer	17:3	O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance and all thy
jer	17:4	And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage
jer	17:5	Thus saith the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and
jer	17:6	For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see
jer	17:7	Blessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope the
jer	17:8	For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that
jer	17:9	The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked:
jer	17:11	As the partridge sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not; so he
jer	17:12	A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our
jer	17:13	O LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be
jer	17:14	Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be
jer	17:15	Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of the LORD? let it
jer	17:16	As for me, I have not hastened from being a pastor to follow
jer	17:17	Be not a terror unto me: thou art my hope in the day of evil.
jer	17:18	Let them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me be
jer	17:19	Thus said the LORD unto me; Go and stand in the gate of the
jer	17:22	Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath
jer	17:23	But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their
jer	17:24	And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me,
jer	17:25	Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and
jer	17:26	And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the
jer	17:27	But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day,
jer	18:1	The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 18:2
jer	18:3	Then I went down to the potter’s house, and, behold, he wrought a
jer	18:4	And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the
jer	18:5	Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 18:6 O house of
jer	18:7	At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning
jer	18:9	And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and
jer	18:11	Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the
jer	18:12	And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own
jer	18:13	Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ask ye now among the heathen, who
jer	18:14	Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh from the rock
jer	18:17	I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I
jer	18:18	Then said they, Come and let us devise devices against Jeremiah;
jer	18:19	Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the voice of them that
jer	18:20	Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit
jer	18:21	Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out
jer	18:22	Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a
jer	18:23	Yet, LORD, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me:
jer	19:1	Thus saith the LORD, Go and get a potter’s earthen bottle, and
jer	19:4	Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and
jer	19:6	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that this place
jer	19:7	And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this
jer	19:8	And I will make this city desolate, and an hissing; every one
jer	19:9	And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the
jer	19:10	Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go
jer	19:12	Thus will I do unto this place, saith the LORD, and to the
jer	19:14	Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the LORD had sent him to
jer	20:1	Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief
jer	20:2	Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks
jer	20:3	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth
jer	20:4	For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will make thee a terror to
jer	20:5	Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all
jer	20:6	And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into
jer	20:7	O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived; thou art
jer	20:8	For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil;
jer	20:9	Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more
jer	20:10	For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report,
jer	20:11	But the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my
jer	20:12	But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous, and seest the
jer	20:13	Sing unto the LORD, praise ye the LORD: for he hath delivered
jer	20:14	Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my
jer	20:15	Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A
jer	20:16	And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew, and
jer	20:18	Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow,
jer	21:3	Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah: 21:4
jer	21:5	And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and
jer	21:6	And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and
jer	21:7	And afterward, saith the LORD, I will deliver Zedekiah king of
jer	21:8	And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the LORD; Behold,
jer	21:9	He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the
jer	21:10	For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for
jer	21:11	And touching the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear ye the
jer	21:13	Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, and rock
jer	22:1	Thus saith the LORD; Go down to the house of the king of Judah,
jer	22:4	For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the
jer	22:5	But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith the
jer	22:6	For thus saith the LORD unto the king’s house of Judah; Thou art
jer	22:7	And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his
jer	22:8	And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say
jer	22:10	Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: but weep sore for
jer	22:11	For thus saith the LORD touching Shallum the son of Josiah king
jer	22:13	Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his
jer	22:15	Shalt thou reign, because thou closest thyself in cedar? did not
jer	22:17	But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness,
jer	22:18	Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of
jer	22:20	Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan, and
jer	22:21	I spake unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will not
jer	22:22	The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go
jer	22:23	O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how
jer	22:26	And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into
jer	22:27	But to the land whereunto they desire to return, thither shall
jer	22:28	Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel
jer	22:30	Thus saith the LORD, Write ye this man childless, a man that
jer	23:1	Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my
jer	23:2	Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel against the pastors
jer	23:3	And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries
jer	23:4	And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and
jer	23:5	Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto
jer	23:6	In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely:
jer	23:7	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that they shall
jer	23:9	Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my
jer	23:10	For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the
jer	23:11	For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I
jer	23:12	Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the
jer	23:13	And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they
jer	23:14	I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing:
jer	23:15	Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets;
jer	23:16	Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the
jer	23:17	They say still unto them that despise me, The LORD hath said, Ye
jer	23:18	For who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD, and hath
jer	23:19	Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury, even a
jer	23:20	The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have executed,
jer	23:21	I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken
jer	23:22	But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to
jer	23:23	Am I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God afar off?
jer	23:24	Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him?
jer	23:25	I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my
jer	23:26	How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that
jer	23:28	The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that
jer	23:29	Is not my word like as a fire? saith the LORD; and like a hammer
jer	23:31	Behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that use
jer	23:32	Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the
jer	23:33	And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask
jer	23:34	And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that
jer	23:35	Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to
jer	23:37	Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the LORD answered
jer	23:40	And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a
jer	24:1	The LORD shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set
jer	24:2	One basket had very good figs, even like the figs that are first
jer	24:3	Then said the LORD unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I
jer	24:4	Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 24:5 Thus saith
jer	24:6	For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring
jer	24:7	And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the LORD: and
jer	24:8	And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil;
jer	24:10	And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among
jer	25:1	The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah
jer	25:4	And the LORD hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets,
jer	25:5	They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and
jer	25:7	Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the LORD; that ye might
jer	25:8	Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Because ye have not heard
jer	25:10	Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice
jer	25:11	And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment;
jer	25:12	And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished,
jer	25:13	And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have
jer	25:14	For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them
jer	25:15	For thus saith the LORD God of Israel unto me; Take the wine cup
jer	25:16	And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the
jer	25:17	Then took I the cup at the LORD’s hand, and made all the nations
jer	25:25	And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all
jer	25:27	Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of
jer	25:28	And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to
jer	25:29	For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my
jer	25:30	Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say
jer	25:31	A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the LORD
jer	25:32	Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from
jer	25:33	And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of
jer	25:34	Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes,
jer	25:35	And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal
jer	25:36	A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the
jer	25:37	And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce
jer	25:38	He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is
jer	26:1	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king
jer	26:3	If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way,
jer	26:4	And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; If ye will not
jer	26:7	So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah
jer	26:8	Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking
jer	26:9	Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This
jer	26:10	When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up
jer	26:11	Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to
jer	26:12	Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people,
jer	26:13	Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the
jer	26:14	As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as seemeth good
jer	26:15	But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall
jer	26:16	Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to
jer	26:17	Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all
jer	26:19	Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to
jer	26:20	And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the
jer	26:21	And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all
jer	26:22	And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the
jer	26:23	And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto
jer	26:24	Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with
jer	27:1	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king
jer	27:6	And now have I given all these lands into the hand of
jer	27:7	And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son’s son,
jer	27:8	And it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which will
jer	27:9	Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners,
jer	27:10	For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your
jer	27:11	But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king
jer	27:12	I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these
jer	27:13	Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the
jer	27:15	For I have not sent them, saith the LORD, yet they prophesy a
jer	27:16	Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus
jer	27:17	Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live:
jer	27:19	For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and
jer	27:20	Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried
jer	28:1	And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign
jer	28:3	Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the
jer	28:5	Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the
jer	28:7	Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears,
jer	28:9	The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the
jer	28:10	Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet
jer	28:11	And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying,
jer	28:12	Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the prophet, after
jer	28:14	For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put
jer	28:15	Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear
jer	28:16	Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from off
jer	28:17	So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.
jer	29:1	Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet
jer	29:7	And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be
jer	29:8	For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your
jer	29:9	For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent
jer	29:10	For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years be
jer	29:11	For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD,
jer	29:12	Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me,
jer	29:13	And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me
jer	29:14	And I will be found of you, saith the LORD: and I will turn away
jer	29:15	Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised us up prophets in
jer	29:18	And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and
jer	29:20	Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the captivity,
jer	29:24	Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,
jer	29:25	Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying,
jer	29:27	Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth,
jer	29:29	And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of
jer	29:30	Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying, 29:31 Send
jer	30:1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 30:2 Thus
jer	30:3	For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring again
jer	30:4	And these are the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and
jer	30:5	For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of
jer	30:6	Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child?
jer	30:8	For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts,
jer	30:10	Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD;
jer	30:11	For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make
jer	30:12	For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound
jer	30:13	There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up:
jer	30:14	All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I
jer	30:15	Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow is incurable
jer	30:16	Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all
jer	30:17	For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy
jer	30:18	Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of
jer	30:19	And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them
jer	30:20	Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their
jer	30:21	And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor
jer	30:22	And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.
jer	30:23	Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a
jer	30:24	The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he hath
jer	31:1	At the same time, saith the LORD, will I be the God of all the
jer	31:2	Thus saith the LORD, The people which were left of the sword
jer	31:3	The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved
jer	31:4	Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of
jer	31:5	Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the
jer	31:6	For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the mount
jer	31:7	For thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout
jer	31:8	Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them
jer	31:9	They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead
jer	31:10	Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare it in the
jer	31:11	For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand
jer	31:12	Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and
jer	31:13	Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and
jer	31:14	And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my
jer	31:15	Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation,
jer	31:16	Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine
jer	31:17	And there is hope in thine end, saith the LORD, that thy
jer	31:18	I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast
jer	31:19	Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was
jer	31:20	Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I
jer	31:21	Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thine heart
jer	31:22	How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for
jer	31:23	Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they
jer	31:24	And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities
jer	31:25	For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every
jer	31:26	Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.
jer	31:27	Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will sow the house
jer	31:28	And it shall come to pass, that like as I have watched over
jer	31:29	In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a
jer	31:30	But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that
jer	31:31	Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new
jer	31:34	And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every
jer	31:35	Thus saith the LORD, which giveth the sun for a light by day,
jer	31:37	Thus saith the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the
jer	31:38	Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be
jer	31:39	And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon
jer	31:40	And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and
jer	32:1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of
jer	32:2	For then the king of Babylon’s army besieged Jerusalem: and
jer	32:3	For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore
jer	32:4	And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of
jer	32:6	And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
jer	32:7	Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto
jer	32:8	So Hanameel mine uncle’s son came to me in the court of the
jer	32:9	And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle’s son, that was in
jer	32:10	And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took
jer	32:11	So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was
jer	32:13	And I charged Baruch before them, saying, 32:14 Thus saith the
jer	32:15	For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and
jer	32:16	Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto
jer	32:18	Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the
jer	32:25	And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy thee the field for
jer	32:26	Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying, 32:27
jer	32:30	For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only
jer	32:31	For this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and
jer	32:33	And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though
jer	32:34	But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by
jer	32:35	And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley
jer	32:36	And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel,
jer	32:41	Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant
jer	32:42	For thus saith the LORD; Like as I have brought all this great
jer	32:43	And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is
jer	32:44	Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and
jer	33:1	Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second time,
jer	33:4	For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses
jer	33:6	Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them,
jer	33:7	And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of
jer	33:8	And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they
jer	33:9	And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour
jer	33:10	Thus saith the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place,
jer	33:11	The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the
jer	33:12	Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is
jer	33:13	In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and
jer	33:14	Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will perform that
jer	33:15	In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of
jer	33:16	In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell
jer	33:17	For thus saith the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit
jer	33:19	And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying, 33:20 Thus
jer	33:22	As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of
jer	33:23	Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, 33:24
jer	33:25	Thus saith the LORD; If my covenant be not with day and night,
jer	34:1	The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when
jer	34:4	Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus
jer	34:6	Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah
jer	34:8	This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after
jer	34:10	Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered
jer	34:11	But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the
jer	34:12	Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD,
jer	34:15	And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in
jer	34:17	Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in
jer	34:18	And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant,
jer	34:21	And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the
jer	34:22	Behold, I will command, saith the LORD, and cause them to return
jer	35:1	The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of
jer	35:3	Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah,
jer	35:6	But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of
jer	35:8	Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our
jer	35:10	But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according
jer	35:11	But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up
jer	35:12	Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying, 35:13 Thus
jer	35:14	The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his
jer	35:15	I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising
jer	35:16	Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the
jer	35:18	And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith
jer	36:1	And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of
jer	36:3	It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I
jer	36:4	Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote
jer	36:5	And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go
jer	36:7	It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD,
jer	36:8	And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah
jer	36:9	And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of
jer	36:10	Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house
jer	36:11	When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard
jer	36:13	Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had
jer	36:14	Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the
jer	36:15	And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears.
jer	36:16	Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they
jer	36:17	And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write
jer	36:19	Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and
jer	36:20	And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up
jer	36:21	So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of
jer	36:22	Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and
jer	36:23	And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four
jer	36:24	Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the
jer	36:25	Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made
jer	36:26	But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and
jer	36:27	Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king
jer	36:29	And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the
jer	36:31	And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their
jer	36:32	Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the
jer	37:1	And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the
jer	37:2	But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did
jer	37:3	And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and
jer	37:4	Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had
jer	37:5	Then Pharaoh’s army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the
jer	37:6	Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah saying,
jer	37:7	Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the
jer	37:8	And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city,
jer	37:9	Thus saith the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The
jer	37:10	For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that
jer	37:11	And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was
jer	37:13	And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward
jer	37:14	Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the
jer	37:15	Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him,
jer	37:16	When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins,
jer	37:18	Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended
jer	37:21	Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit
jer	38:1	Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of
jer	38:3	Thus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the
jer	38:4	Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let
jer	38:5	Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the
jer	38:6	Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of
jer	38:7	Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was
jer	38:10	Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take
jer	38:11	So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of
jer	38:12	And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these
jer	38:13	So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the
jer	38:14	Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto
jer	38:15	Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee,
jer	38:17	Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God
jer	38:18	But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon’s princes,
jer	38:19	And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the
jer	38:20	But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech
jer	38:21	But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD
jer	38:23	So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the
jer	38:24	Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these
jer	38:25	But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they
jer	38:27	Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he
jer	38:28	So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that
jer	39:1	In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month,
jer	39:2	And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the
jer	39:3	And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in
jer	39:4	And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw
jer	39:5	But the Chaldeans’ army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah
jer	39:6	Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah
jer	39:7	Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and bound him with chains,
jer	39:8	And the Chaldeans burned the king’s house, and the houses of the
jer	39:9	Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive
jer	39:10	But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the
jer	39:11	Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning
jer	39:13	So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban,
jer	39:15	Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut
jer	39:17	But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the LORD: and thou
jer	39:18	For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the
jer	40:1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that
jer	40:2	And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him,
jer	40:3	Now the LORD hath brought it, and done according as he hath said:
jer	40:4	And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which were
jer	40:5	Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to
jer	40:6	Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and
jer	40:7	Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields,
jer	40:9	And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them
jer	40:10	As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to serve the
jer	40:11	Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the
jer	40:13	Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
jer	40:15	Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah
jer	41:1	Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of
jer	41:2	Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that
jer	41:3	Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with
jer	41:4	And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah,
jer	41:6	And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet
jer	41:7	And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that
jer	41:8	But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us
jer	41:9	Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the
jer	41:10	Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people
jer	41:11	But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
jer	41:13	Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with
jer	41:14	So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from
jer	41:15	But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight
jer	41:16	Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
jer	42:1	Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of
jer	42:4	Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you;
jer	42:5	Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful
jer	42:6	Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice
jer	42:7	And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD
jer	42:8	Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of
jer	42:11	Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be
jer	42:12	And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon
jer	42:13	But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the
jer	42:17	So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into
jer	42:18	For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine
jer	42:19	The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go ye
jer	42:20	For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the LORD
jer	42:21	And now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not
jer	42:22	Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by
jer	43:1	And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of
jer	43:2	Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of
jer	43:4	So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces,
jer	43:5	But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
jer	43:6	Even men, and women, and children, and the king’s daughters, and
jer	43:7	So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the
jer	43:8	Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes,
jer	43:11	And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, and
jer	43:12	And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and
jer	43:13	He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the
jer	44:1	The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which
jer	44:3	Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke
jer	44:4	Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising
jer	44:5	But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their
jer	44:6	Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was
jer	44:7	Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of
jer	44:11	Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
jer	44:12	And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces
jer	44:13	For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I
jer	44:15	Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense
jer	44:17	But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our
jer	44:18	But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven,
jer	44:19	And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured
jer	44:23	Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned
jer	44:24	Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the
jer	44:26	Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell in
jer	44:27	Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and
jer	44:28	Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the
jer	44:29	And this shall be a sign unto you, saith the LORD, that I will
jer	45:1	The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of
jer	45:4	Thus shalt thou say unto him, The LORD saith thus; Behold, that
jer	45:5	And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not: for,
jer	46:1	The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet against
jer	46:3	Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.
jer	46:4	Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with
jer	46:5	Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back? and
jer	46:6	Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they
jer	46:7	Who is this that cometh up as a flood, whose waters are moved as
jer	46:9	Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men
jer	46:10	For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of
jer	46:11	Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of
jer	46:12	The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry hath filled the
jer	46:13	The word that the LORD spake to Jeremiah the prophet, how
jer	46:14	Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph
jer	46:15	Why are thy valiant men swept away? they stood not, because the
jer	46:16	He made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another: and they said,
jer	46:17	They did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he
jer	46:18	As I live, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts,
jer	46:19	O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into
jer	46:20	Egypt is like a very fair heifer, but destruction cometh; it
jer	46:21	Also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks;
jer	46:22	The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall march
jer	46:23	They shall cut down her forest, saith the LORD, though it cannot
jer	46:24	The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be
jer	46:25	The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saith; Behold, I will
jer	46:27	But fear not thou, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O
jer	46:28	Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the LORD: for I am with
jer	47:1	The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against
jer	47:2	Thus saith the LORD; Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and
jer	47:3	At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses,
jer	47:4	Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines, and
jer	47:5	Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off with the remnant
jer	47:7	How can it be quiet, seeing the LORD hath given it a charge
jer	48:1	Against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe
jer	48:2	There shall be no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have
jer	48:3	A voice of crying shall be from Horonaim, spoiling and great
jer	48:4	Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.
jer	48:5	For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for
jer	48:6	Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.
jer	48:7	For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures,
jer	48:8	And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall
jer	48:9	Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the
jer	48:10	Cursed be he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and
jer	48:11	Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on
jer	48:12	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will
jer	48:13	And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was
jer	48:14	How say ye, We are mighty and strong men for the war? 48:15
jer	48:16	The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hasteth
jer	48:17	All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his
jer	48:18	Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from thy glory,
jer	48:19	O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that
jer	48:25	The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the
jer	48:26	Make ye him drunken: for he magnified himself against the LORD:
jer	48:27	For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among
jer	48:28	O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the
jer	48:29	We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his
jer	48:30	I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but it shall not be so; his
jer	48:31	Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab;
jer	48:32	O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of
jer	48:33	And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from
jer	48:34	From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, and even unto Jahaz,
jer	48:35	Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that
jer	48:36	Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine
jer	48:37	For every head shall be bald, and every beard clipped: upon all
jer	48:38	There shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of
jer	48:39	They shall howl, saying, How is it broken down! how hath Moab
jer	48:40	For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and
jer	48:41	Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the
jer	48:42	And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath
jer	48:43	Fear, and the pit, and the snare, shall be upon thee, O
jer	48:44	He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he
jer	48:45	They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the
jer	48:46	Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for
jer	48:47	Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days,
jer	49:1	Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no
jer	49:3	Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah,
jer	49:4	Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O
jer	49:6	And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of
jer	49:7	Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more
jer	49:9	If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave some
jer	49:10	But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places,
jer	49:11	Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and
jer	49:12	For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment was not to
jer	49:13	For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall
jer	49:14	I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent
jer	49:15	For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, and despised
jer	49:16	Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, and the pride of thine
jer	49:17	Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it
jer	49:18	As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour
jer	49:19	Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan
jer	49:21	The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the
jer	49:22	Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his
jer	49:23	Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they
jer	49:24	Damascus is waxed feeble, and turneth herself to flee, and fear
jer	49:25	How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy! 49:26
jer	49:27	And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall
jer	49:28	Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which
jer	49:29	Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall
jer	49:30	Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor,
jer	49:31	Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without
jer	49:32	And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their
jer	49:33	And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation for
jer	49:34	The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against
jer	49:35	Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of
jer	49:36	And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters
jer	49:37	For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and
jer	49:39	But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring
jer	50:1	The word that the LORD spake against Babylon and against the land
jer	50:2	Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard;
jer	50:3	For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which
jer	50:4	In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of
jer	50:5	They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward,
jer	50:6	My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them
jer	50:7	All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries
jer	50:8	Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land
jer	50:9	For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an
jer	50:10	And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be
jer	50:11	Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of
jer	50:13	Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but
jer	50:14	Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that
jer	50:15	Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her
jer	50:16	Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle
jer	50:17	Israel is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away:
jer	50:18	Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
jer	50:19	And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall
jer	50:20	In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of
jer	50:21	Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and
jer	50:22	A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.
jer	50:23	How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how
jer	50:25	The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the
jer	50:26	Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses:
jer	50:27	Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe
jer	50:28	The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of
jer	50:29	Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the

jer	51:63	And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this
jer	52:1	Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and
jer	52:2	And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, according
jer	52:3	For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem
jer	52:4	And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth
jer	52:5	So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
jer	52:6	And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the
jer	52:7	Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and
jer	52:8	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and
jer	52:9	Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of

jer	52:18	The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the
jer	52:19	And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the
jer	52:20	The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that were
jer	52:21	And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was
jer	52:22	And a chapiter of brass was upon it; and the height of one

jer	52:26	So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought
jer	52:27	And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in

lam	1:3	Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of
lam	1:4	The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts:
lam	1:5	Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD
lam	1:6	And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her
lam	1:7	Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her
lam	1:8	Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all
lam	1:9	Her filthiness is in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end;

lam	1:18	The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his

lam	1:20	Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress: my bowels are troubled;
lam	1:21	They have heard that I sigh: there is none to comfort me: all
lam	1:22	Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as
lam	2:1	How hath the LORD covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his
lam	2:3	He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he
lam	2:4	He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand
lam	2:5	The LORD was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath
lam	2:6	And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of

lam	2:17	The LORD hath done that which he had devised; he hath fulfilled
lam	2:18	Their heart cried unto the LORD, O wall of the daughter of Zion,
lam	2:19	Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour
lam	2:20	Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall
lam	2:22	Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so
lam	3:1	I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.
lam	3:2	He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light.
lam	3:3	Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me all
lam	3:4	My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.
lam	3:5	He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and
lam	3:6	He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old.
lam	3:7	He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my
lam	3:8	Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.
lam	3:9	He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths
lam	3:10	He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret
lam	3:11	He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath
lam	3:12	He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.
lam	3:13	He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.
lam	3:14	I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day.
lam	3:15	He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with
lam	3:16	He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered
lam	3:17	And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat
lam	3:18	And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:
lam	3:19	Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the
lam	3:20	My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.
lam	3:21	This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.
lam	3:22	It is of the LORD’s mercies that we are not consumed, because his
lam	3:23	They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.
lam	3:24	The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in

lam	3:26	It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the
lam	3:27	It is good for a man that he bear the yoke of his youth.
lam	3:28	He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it
lam	3:29	He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.
lam	3:30	He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full
lam	3:31	For the LORD will not cast off for ever: 3:32 But though he cause
lam	3:33	For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.
lam	3:34	To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth.
lam	3:35	To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most

lam	3:41	Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.
lam	3:42	We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.
lam	3:43	Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain,
lam	3:44	Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should

lam	3:47	Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.
lam	3:48	Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of

lam	3:50	Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.
lam	3:51	Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my
lam	3:52	Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.
lam	3:53	They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon
lam	3:54	Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off.
lam	3:55	I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.
lam	3:56	Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at
lam	3:57	Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou
lam	3:58	O LORD, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast
lam	3:59	O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.
lam	3:60	Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations
lam	3:61	Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their

lam	4:4	The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth
lam	4:5	They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they
lam	4:6	For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is

lam	4:9	They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be
lam	4:10	The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children:

lam	4:13	For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests,

lam	5:3	We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows.
lam	5:4	We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us.
lam	5:5	Our necks are under persecution: we labour, and have no rest.
lam	5:6	We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to
lam	5:7	Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their
lam	5:8	Servants have ruled over us: there is none that doth deliver us
lam	5:9	We gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword
lam	5:10	Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine.
lam	5:11	They ravished the women in Zion, and the maids in the cities of

lam	5:22	But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us.
ezk	1:1	Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month,
ezk	1:2	In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king
ezk	1:4	And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a
ezk	1:5	Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living
ezk	1:6	And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.
ezk	1:7	And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was
ezk	1:8	And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four
ezk	1:9	Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they
ezk	1:10	As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a
ezk	1:11	Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two
ezk	1:12	And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was
ezk	1:13	As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was
ezk	1:14	And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a

ezk	1:17	When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned
ezk	1:18	As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful;
ezk	1:19	And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and
ezk	1:20	Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their
ezk	1:21	When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood;
ezk	1:22	And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living
ezk	1:23	And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward
ezk	1:24	And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the

ezk	2:5	And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear,
ezk	2:6	And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of
ezk	2:7	And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear,
ezk	2:8	But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou

ezk	3:2	So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.
ezk	3:3	And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill
ezk	3:4	And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of

ezk	3:9	As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear
ezk	3:10	Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall
ezk	3:11	And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of

ezk	3:13	I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that
ezk	3:14	So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in
ezk	3:15	Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by

ezk	3:21	Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous

ezk	3:27	But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt
ezk	4:1	Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee,
ezk	4:3	Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of
ezk	4:4	Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the

ezk	4:6	And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side,
ezk	4:7	Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem,
ezk	4:8	And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn
ezk	4:9	Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and
ezk	4:10	And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty
ezk	4:11	Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin:
ezk	4:12	And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it
ezk	4:13	And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat

ezk	5:10	Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee,
ezk	5:11	Wherefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD; Surely, because thou
ezk	5:12	A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with
ezk	5:13	Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury
ezk	5:14	Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations
ezk	5:15	So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an
ezk	5:16	When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which
ezk	6:1	And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 6:2 Son of man, set
ezk	6:3	And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD;
ezk	6:4	And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be
ezk	6:5	And I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before
ezk	6:6	In all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste, and the

ezk	6:8	Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have some that shall

ezk	6:10	And they shall know that I am the LORD, and that I have not said
ezk	6:11	Thus saith the Lord GOD; Smite with thine hand, and stamp with

ezk	7:3	Now is the end come upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon
ezk	7:4	And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I
ezk	7:5	Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come.
ezk	7:6	An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it
ezk	7:7	The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land:
ezk	7:8	Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine
ezk	7:9	And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will
ezk	7:10	Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth;
ezk	7:11	Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them shall
ezk	7:12	The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer
ezk	7:13	For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although
ezk	7:14	They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none
ezk	7:15	The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within:
ezk	7:16	But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the
ezk	7:17	All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.
ezk	7:18	They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall
ezk	7:19	They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall
ezk	7:20	As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they
ezk	7:21	And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey,
ezk	7:22	My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my
ezk	7:23	Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city
ezk	7:24	Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall
ezk	7:25	Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be
ezk	7:26	Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon
ezk	7:27	The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with
ezk	8:1	And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the
ezk	8:2	Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from
ezk	8:3	And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of
ezk	8:4	And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according
ezk	8:5	Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way
ezk	8:6	He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do?
ezk	8:7	And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked,
ezk	8:8	Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I
ezk	8:9	And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations
ezk	8:10	So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things,
ezk	8:11	And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the
ezk	8:12	Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the
ezk	8:13	He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see
ezk	8:14	Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD’s house
ezk	8:15	Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn
ezk	8:16	And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD’s house, and,
ezk	8:17	Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a
ezk	8:18	Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare,
ezk	9:1	He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them
ezk	9:2	And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which
ezk	9:3	And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub,
ezk	9:4	And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city,
ezk	9:5	And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through
ezk	9:7	And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with
ezk	9:8	And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left,
ezk	9:10	And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have
ezk	9:11	And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the inkhorn by
ezk	10:1	Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the
ezk	10:2	And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in
ezk	10:3	Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the
ezk	10:4	Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and stood
ezk	10:5	And the sound of the cherubims’ wings was heard even to the outer
ezk	10:6	And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed
ezk	10:7	And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the
ezk	10:8	And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man’s hand
ezk	10:9	And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one
ezk	10:10	And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if
ezk	10:11	When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not
ezk	10:12	And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and
ezk	10:13	As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O
ezk	10:14	And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a
ezk	10:15	And the cherubims were lifted up. This is the living creature
ezk	10:16	And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when
ezk	10:17	When they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up,
ezk	10:18	Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of
ezk	10:19	And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the
ezk	10:20	This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel
ezk	10:21	Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and
ezk	10:22	And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw
ezk	11:1	Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east
ezk	11:2	Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise
ezk	11:4	Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.
ezk	11:5	And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak;
ezk	11:6	Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled
ezk	11:7	Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid
ezk	11:8	Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you,
ezk	11:9	And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you
ezk	11:10	Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of
ezk	11:11	This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the
ezk	11:13	And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of
ezk	11:15	Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy
ezk	11:16	Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast
ezk	11:17	Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you
ezk	11:18	And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the
ezk	11:19	And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit
ezk	11:21	But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their
ezk	11:22	Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels
ezk	11:23	And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city,
ezk	11:24	Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by
ezk	11:25	Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the
ezk	12:1	The word of the LORD also came unto me, saying, 12:2 Son of man,
ezk	12:3	Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and
ezk	12:4	Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as
ezk	12:5	Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.
ezk	12:6	In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders, and carry
ezk	12:7	And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day,
ezk	12:8	And in the morning came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,
ezk	12:9	Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house,
ezk	12:11	Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done
ezk	12:12	And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder
ezk	12:13	My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my
ezk	12:14	And I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to
ezk	12:15	And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall scatter
ezk	12:16	But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the
ezk	12:17	Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 12:18 Son of
ezk	12:20	And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the
ezk	12:21	And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 12:22 Son of man,
ezk	12:24	For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering
ezk	12:25	For I am the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak
ezk	12:26	Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying.
ezk	12:27	Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision
ezk	12:28	Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; There shall
ezk	13:1	And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 13:2 Son of man,
ezk	13:5	Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for
ezk	13:6	They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD
ezk	13:7	Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying
ezk	13:9	And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and
ezk	13:10	Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying,
ezk	13:12	Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you,
ezk	13:14	So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with
ezk	13:15	Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them
ezk	13:17	Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of
ezk	13:21	Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of
ezk	13:22	Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad,
ezk	13:23	Therefore ye shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations:
ezk	14:1	Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before
ezk	14:2	And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 14:3 Son of man,
ezk	14:5	That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because
ezk	14:6	Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
ezk	14:7	For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that
ezk	14:9	And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the
ezk	14:10	And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the
ezk	14:12	The word of the LORD came again to me, saying, 14:13 Son of man,
ezk	14:15	If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they
ezk	14:17	Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through
ezk	14:19	Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury
ezk	14:21	For thus saith the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four
ezk	14:22	Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be
ezk	14:23	And they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their
ezk	15:1	And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 15:2 Son of man,
ezk	15:4	Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth
ezk	15:7	And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one
ezk	15:8	And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a
ezk	16:1	Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 16:2 Son of man,
ezk	16:4	And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was
ezk	16:5	None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have
ezk	16:6	And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own
ezk	16:7	I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou
ezk	16:8	Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time
ezk	16:9	Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy
ezk	16:10	I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with
ezk	16:11	I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy
ezk	16:12	And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears,
ezk	16:13	Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was
ezk	16:14	And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for
ezk	16:15	But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the
ezk	16:16	And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high
ezk	16:17	Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my
ezk	16:19	My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey,
ezk	16:20	Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou
ezk	16:23	And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto
ezk	16:25	Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and
ezk	16:26	Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy
ezk	16:27	Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and
ezk	16:28	Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou
ezk	16:29	Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of
ezk	16:30	How weak is thine heart, saith the LORD GOD, seeing thou doest
ezk	16:33	They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all
ezk	16:34	And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms,
ezk	16:35	Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD: 16:36 Thus saith
ezk	16:38	And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed
ezk	16:39	And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw
ezk	16:40	They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall
ezk	16:41	And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute
ezk	16:42	So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy
ezk	16:43	Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast
ezk	16:44	Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb
ezk	16:45	Thou art thy mother’s daughter, that lotheth her husband and her
ezk	16:46	And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that
ezk	16:47	Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their
ezk	16:48	As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done,
ezk	16:49	Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride,
ezk	16:50	And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me:
ezk	16:51	Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast
ezk	16:52	Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame
ezk	16:53	When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom
ezk	16:55	When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their
ezk	16:56	For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day
ezk	16:58	Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the
ezk	16:59	For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou
ezk	16:60	Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days
ezk	16:61	Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou
ezk	16:62	And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know
ezk	17:1	And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 17:2 Son of man,
ezk	17:5	He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a
ezk	17:6	And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose
ezk	17:7	There was also another great eagle with great wings and many
ezk	17:8	It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might
ezk	17:9	Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper? shall he not
ezk	17:10	Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not
ezk	17:11	Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 17:12 Say
ezk	17:15	But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into
ezk	17:17	Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company
ezk	17:19	Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely mine oath
ezk	17:20	And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my
ezk	17:21	And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the
ezk	17:22	Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest branch
ezk	17:24	And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have
ezk	18:1	The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying, 18:2 What mean
ezk	18:4	Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also
ezk	18:5	But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right, 18:6
ezk	18:10	If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that
ezk	18:14	Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father’s sins
ezk	18:18	As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his
ezk	18:19	Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the
ezk	18:20	The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the
ezk	18:21	But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath
ezk	18:22	All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be
ezk	18:23	Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the
ezk	18:24	But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and
ezk	18:25	Yet ye say, The way of the LORD is not equal. Hear now, O house
ezk	18:27	Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that
ezk	18:28	Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his
ezk	18:29	Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the LORD is not equal.
ezk	18:30	Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one
ezk	18:31	Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have
ezk	19:1	Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
ezk	19:2	And say, What is thy mother? A lioness: she lay down among lions,
ezk	19:3	And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and
ezk	19:4	The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and
ezk	19:5	Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then
ezk	19:6	And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion,
ezk	19:7	And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their
ezk	19:8	Then the nations set against him on every side from the
ezk	19:9	And they put him in ward in chains, and brought him to the king
ezk	19:10	Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters:
ezk	19:11	And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule,
ezk	19:12	But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground,
ezk	19:13	And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty
ezk	19:14	And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, which hath
ezk	20:1	And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the
ezk	20:2	Then came the word of the LORD unto me, saying, 20:3 Son of man,
ezk	20:4	Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them? cause
ezk	20:8	But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: they
ezk	20:9	But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted
ezk	20:10	Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt,
ezk	20:11	And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments, which
ezk	20:12	Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me
ezk	20:13	But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness:
ezk	20:14	But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted
ezk	20:15	Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I
ezk	20:17	Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither
ezk	20:18	But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in
ezk	20:21	Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked
ezk	20:22	Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name’s
ezk	20:23	I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I
ezk	20:25	Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and
ezk	20:27	Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say
ezk	20:28	For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I
ezk	20:29	Then I said unto them, What is the high place whereunto ye go?
ezk	20:30	Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
ezk	20:32	And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that
ezk	20:33	As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and
ezk	20:35	And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and
ezk	20:36	Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the
ezk	20:37	And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you
ezk	20:39	As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye,
ezk	20:40	For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of
ezk	20:41	I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out
ezk	20:42	And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall bring you
ezk	20:43	And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings,
ezk	20:44	And ye shall know that I am the LORD when I have wrought with
ezk	20:45	Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 20:46 Son of
ezk	20:48	And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it: it
ezk	20:49	Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Doth he not speak
ezk	21:4	Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the
ezk	21:6	Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of thy loins;
ezk	21:7	And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou?
ezk	21:8	Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 21:9 Son of man,
ezk	21:11	And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled:
ezk	21:12	Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it
ezk	21:13	Because it is a trial, and what if the sword contemn even the
ezk	21:14	Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thine hands
ezk	21:15	I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that
ezk	21:16	Go thee one way or other, either on the right hand, or on the
ezk	21:17	I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury
ezk	21:18	The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying, 21:19 Also,
ezk	21:20	Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the
ezk	21:21	For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the
ezk	21:22	At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint
ezk	21:23	And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight,
ezk	21:24	Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your
ezk	21:25	And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come,
ezk	21:27	I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no
ezk	21:28	And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD
ezk	21:30	Shall I cause it to return into his sheath? I will judge thee in
ezk	21:31	And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow
ezk	21:32	Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the
ezk	22:1	Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 22:2 Now,
ezk	22:3	Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood
ezk	22:4	Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast
ezk	22:5	Those that be near, and those that be far from thee, shall mock
ezk	22:6	Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their
ezk	22:7	In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of
ezk	22:8	Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my
ezk	22:9	In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they
ezk	22:10	In thee have they discovered their fathers’ nakedness: in thee
ezk	22:11	And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour’s wife;
ezk	22:12	In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken
ezk	22:13	Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain
ezk	22:14	Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the
ezk	22:15	And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in
ezk	22:16	And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of
ezk	22:17	And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 22:18 Son of man,
ezk	22:19	Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become
ezk	22:20	As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin,
ezk	22:21	Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my
ezk	22:22	As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be
ezk	22:23	And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 22:24 Son of man,
ezk	22:25	There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like
ezk	22:26	Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy
ezk	22:27	Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the
ezk	22:28	And her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter, seeing
ezk	22:29	The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised
ezk	22:30	And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the
ezk	22:31	Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have
ezk	23:1	The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 23:2 Son of man,
ezk	23:4	And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her
ezk	23:5	And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on
ezk	23:7	Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that
ezk	23:8	Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her
ezk	23:9	Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into
ezk	23:10	These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her
ezk	23:11	And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in
ezk	23:12	She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers
ezk	23:13	Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way,
ezk	23:14	And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men
ezk	23:16	And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them,
ezk	23:17	And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they
ezk	23:18	So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness:
ezk	23:19	Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the
ezk	23:20	For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh
ezk	23:21	Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in
ezk	23:22	Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will
ezk	23:24	And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and
ezk	23:25	And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal
ezk	23:26	They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy
ezk	23:27	Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy
ezk	23:28	For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into
ezk	23:30	I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a
ezk	23:31	Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give
ezk	23:32	Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister’s cup
ezk	23:33	Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup
ezk	23:34	Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt break
ezk	23:35	Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten
ezk	23:36	The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge
ezk	23:38	Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my
ezk	23:39	For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they
ezk	23:40	And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far,
ezk	23:42	And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with
ezk	23:43	Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now
ezk	23:45	And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of
ezk	23:46	For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon
ezk	23:47	And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them
ezk	23:48	Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all
ezk	23:49	And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall
ezk	24:1	Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of
ezk	24:3	And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them,
ezk	24:5	Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it,
ezk	24:6	Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the
ezk	24:7	For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of
ezk	24:9	Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will
ezk	24:10	Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it
ezk	24:11	Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it
ezk	24:12	She hath wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not
ezk	24:13	In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged thee, and
ezk	24:14	I the LORD have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do
ezk	24:15	Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 24:16 Son of
ezk	24:17	Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of
ezk	24:18	So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife
ezk	24:19	And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these
ezk	24:22	And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips,
ezk	24:23	And your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon
ezk	24:24	Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath
ezk	24:25	Also, thou son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take
ezk	25:1	The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 25:2 Son of man,
ezk	25:5	And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a
ezk	25:6	For thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast clapped thine
ezk	25:8	Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say,
ezk	25:11	And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that
ezk	25:12	Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Edom hath dealt against
ezk	25:14	And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people
ezk	25:15	Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by
ezk	25:17	And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious
ezk	26:1	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first day of the
ezk	26:4	And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her
ezk	26:5	It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the
ezk	26:6	And her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the
ezk	26:7	For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring upon Tyrus
ezk	26:8	He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field: and he
ezk	26:9	And he shall set engines of war against thy walls, and with his
ezk	26:10	By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover
ezk	26:11	With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy
ezk	26:12	And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of
ezk	26:13	And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound
ezk	26:14	And I will make thee like the top of a rock: thou shalt be a
ezk	26:15	Thus saith the Lord GOD to Tyrus; Shall not the isles shake at
ezk	26:17	And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to thee,
ezk	26:19	For thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall make thee a desolate
ezk	27:1	The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 27:2 Now, thou
ezk	27:4	Thy borders are in the midst of the seas, thy builders have
ezk	27:5	They have made all thy ship boards of fir trees of Senir: they
ezk	27:6	Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company of
ezk	27:7	Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou
ezk	27:8	The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise
ezk	27:9	The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee thy
ezk	27:10	They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy
ezk	27:11	The men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round
ezk	27:12	Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind
ezk	27:13	Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy merchants: they traded
ezk	27:14	They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses
ezk	27:15	The men of Dedan were thy merchants; many isles were the
ezk	27:16	Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares
ezk	27:17	Judah, and the land of Israel, they were thy merchants: they
ezk	27:18	Damascus was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy
ezk	27:19	Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs:
ezk	27:20	Dedan was thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots.
ezk	27:21	Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with thee in
ezk	27:22	The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were thy merchants: they
ezk	27:23	Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and
ezk	27:24	These were thy merchants in all sorts of things, in blue
ezk	27:25	The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market: and thou
ezk	27:26	Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind
ezk	27:27	Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and
ezk	27:28	The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.
ezk	27:29	And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots of
ezk	27:32	And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee,
ezk	27:34	In the time when thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths
ezk	27:35	All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee,
ezk	27:36	The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou shalt be
ezk	28:1	The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 28:2 Son of man,
ezk	28:4	With thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten
ezk	28:8	They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the
ezk	28:9	Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God? but
ezk	28:10	Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of
ezk	28:11	Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 28:12 Son of
ezk	28:13	Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone
ezk	28:14	Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee
ezk	28:15	Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast
ezk	28:16	By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst
ezk	28:17	Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast
ezk	28:18	Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine
ezk	28:19	All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at
ezk	28:20	Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 28:21 Son of
ezk	28:23	For I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her streets;
ezk	28:24	And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of
ezk	28:25	Thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall have gathered the house of
ezk	28:26	And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and
ezk	29:1	In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth day of the
ezk	29:4	But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of
ezk	29:5	And I will leave thee thrown into the wilderness, thee and all
ezk	29:6	And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the LORD,
ezk	29:7	When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and
ezk	29:8	Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring a sword
ezk	29:9	And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall
ezk	29:10	Behold, therefore I am against thee, and against thy rivers, and
ezk	29:11	No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall
ezk	29:12	And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the
ezk	29:13	Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I
ezk	29:14	And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause
ezk	29:15	It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt
ezk	29:16	And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel,
ezk	29:17	And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the
ezk	29:20	I have given him the land of Egypt for his labour wherewith he
ezk	29:21	In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud
ezk	30:1	The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 30:2 Son of man,
ezk	30:3	For the day is near, even the day of the LORD is near, a cloudy
ezk	30:4	And the sword shall come upon Egypt, and great pain shall be in
ezk	30:5	Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled people, and
ezk	30:6	Thus saith the LORD; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and
ezk	30:7	And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are
ezk	30:8	And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I have set a fire in
ezk	30:9	In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make
ezk	30:10	Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also make the multitude of Egypt
ezk	30:11	He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall
ezk	30:12	And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand
ezk	30:13	Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also destroy the idols, and I
ezk	30:14	And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan, and
ezk	30:15	And I will pour my fury upon Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I
ezk	30:16	And I will set fire in Egypt: Sin shall have great pain, and No
ezk	30:17	The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword:
ezk	30:18	At Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened, when I shall
ezk	30:19	Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt: and they shall know that
ezk	30:20	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, in
ezk	30:22	Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against Pharaoh
ezk	30:23	And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will
ezk	30:24	And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put
ezk	30:25	But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the
ezk	30:26	And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse
ezk	31:1	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in
ezk	31:4	The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her
ezk	31:5	Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the
ezk	31:6	All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under
ezk	31:7	Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches:
ezk	31:8	The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees
ezk	31:9	I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that
ezk	31:10	Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up
ezk	31:12	And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off,
ezk	31:13	Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all
ezk	31:15	Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the
ezk	31:16	I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I
ezk	31:17	They also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain
ezk	31:18	To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the
ezk	32:1	And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in
ezk	32:3	Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will therefore spread out my net over
ezk	32:4	Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon
ezk	32:5	And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys
ezk	32:6	I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest,
ezk	32:7	And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and make
ezk	32:8	All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and
ezk	32:9	I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring thy
ezk	32:10	Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings
ezk	32:11	For thus saith the Lord GOD; The sword of the king of Babylon
ezk	32:12	By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall,
ezk	32:13	I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great
ezk	32:14	Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to
ezk	32:15	When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country
ezk	32:16	This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her: the
ezk	32:17	It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day
ezk	32:19	Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with
ezk	32:20	They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the
ezk	32:21	The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst
ezk	32:22	Asshur is there and all her company: his graves are about him:
ezk	32:24	There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all
ezk	32:25	They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her
ezk	32:26	There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves are
ezk	32:27	And they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the
ezk	32:28	Yea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and
ezk	32:29	There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, which with their
ezk	32:30	There be the princes of the north, all of them, and all the
ezk	32:31	Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his
ezk	32:32	For I have caused my terror in the land of the living: and he
ezk	33:1	Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 33:2 Son of man,
ezk	33:4	Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not
ezk	33:5	He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his
ezk	33:6	But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet,
ezk	33:7	So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house
ezk	33:8	When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die;
ezk	33:9	Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it;
ezk	33:10	Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel;
ezk	33:13	When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if
ezk	33:14	Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he
ezk	33:16	None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto
ezk	33:17	Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not
ezk	33:18	When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and
ezk	33:19	But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is
ezk	33:20	Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of
ezk	33:21	And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the
ezk	33:22	Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, afore he
ezk	33:23	Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 33:24 Son of
ezk	33:25	Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with
ezk	33:28	For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her
ezk	33:29	Then shall they know that I am the LORD, when I have laid the
ezk	33:30	Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are
ezk	33:31	And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit
ezk	33:32	And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that
ezk	33:33	And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall
ezk	34:1	And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 34:2 Son of man,
ezk	34:4	The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed
ezk	34:5	And they were scattered, because there is no shepherd: and they
ezk	34:6	My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high
ezk	34:7	Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD; 34:8 As I
ezk	34:11	For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both search
ezk	34:12	As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among
ezk	34:13	And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from
ezk	34:14	I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains
ezk	34:15	I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith
ezk	34:16	I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was
ezk	34:17	And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I
ezk	34:18	Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good
ezk	34:20	Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them; Behold, I, even I,
ezk	34:21	Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed
ezk	34:22	Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a
ezk	34:23	And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed
ezk	34:24	And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a prince
ezk	34:25	And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause
ezk	34:26	And I will make them and the places round about my hill a
ezk	34:27	And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth
ezk	34:28	And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall
ezk	34:29	And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall
ezk	34:30	Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them, and
ezk	34:31	And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your
ezk	35:1	Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 35:2 Son of
ezk	35:4	I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou
ezk	35:5	Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed the blood
ezk	35:7	Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it
ezk	35:8	And I will fill his mountains with his slain men: in thy hills,
ezk	35:9	I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not
ezk	35:10	Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two
ezk	35:12	And thou shalt know that I am the LORD, and that I have heard
ezk	35:13	Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have
ezk	35:14	Thus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will
ezk	35:15	As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel,
ezk	36:1	Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and
ezk	36:6	Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say unto
ezk	36:8	But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your
ezk	36:9	For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall
ezk	36:12	Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel;
ezk	36:13	Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they say unto you, Thou land
ezk	36:15	Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the
ezk	36:16	Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 36:17 Son of
ezk	36:18	Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had
ezk	36:20	And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went, they
ezk	36:21	But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had
ezk	36:22	Therefore say unto the house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD;
ezk	36:23	And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the
ezk	36:24	For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out
ezk	36:25	Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be
ezk	36:26	A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put
ezk	36:27	And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my
ezk	36:28	And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and
ezk	36:29	I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will
ezk	36:30	And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of
ezk	36:31	Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that
ezk	36:32	Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord GOD, be it known
ezk	36:33	Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed
ezk	36:34	And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate
ezk	36:35	And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like
ezk	36:36	Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I
ezk	36:37	Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet for this be enquired of by
ezk	36:38	As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn
ezk	37:1	The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the
ezk	37:3	And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I
ezk	37:4	Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto
ezk	37:5	Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause
ezk	37:7	So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there
ezk	37:8	And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon
ezk	37:9	Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of
ezk	37:10	So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into
ezk	37:11	Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole
ezk	37:12	Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
ezk	37:13	And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your
ezk	37:15	The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 37:16 Moreover,
ezk	37:18	And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee,
ezk	37:20	And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand
ezk	37:21	And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take
ezk	37:23	Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols,
ezk	37:24	And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall
ezk	37:25	And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my
ezk	37:26	Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be
ezk	37:27	My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God,
ezk	37:28	And the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel,
ezk	38:1	And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 38:2 Son of man,
ezk	38:7	Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy
ezk	38:8	After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou
ezk	38:9	Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a
ezk	38:10	Thus saith the Lord GOD; It shall also come to pass, that at the
ezk	38:13	Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the
ezk	38:14	Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith the
ezk	38:17	Thus saith the Lord GOD; Art thou he of whom I have spoken in
ezk	38:19	For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken,
ezk	38:21	And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my
ezk	38:22	And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and
ezk	38:23	Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be
ezk	39:1	Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus
ezk	39:4	Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy
ezk	39:5	Thou shalt fall upon the open field: for I have spoken it, saith
ezk	39:6	And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell
ezk	39:7	So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people
ezk	39:8	Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord GOD; this is
ezk	39:9	And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and
ezk	39:11	And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog
ezk	39:12	And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them,
ezk	39:13	Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be
ezk	39:14	And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing
ezk	39:15	And the passengers that pass through the land, when any seeth a
ezk	39:16	And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah. Thus shall they
ezk	39:17	And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; Speak unto every
ezk	39:18	Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the
ezk	39:19	And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be
ezk	39:20	Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots,
ezk	39:21	And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen
ezk	39:22	So the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God
ezk	39:23	And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into
ezk	39:24	According to their uncleanness and according to their
ezk	39:25	Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Now will I bring again the
ezk	39:27	When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered
ezk	39:29	Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have
ezk	40:1	In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning
ezk	40:2	In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and
ezk	40:3	And he brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose
ezk	40:4	And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and
ezk	40:5	And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in
ezk	40:6	Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and
ezk	40:7	And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad;
ezk	40:8	He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.
ezk	40:9	Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the
ezk	40:10	And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this
ezk	40:11	And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten
ezk	40:12	The space also before the little chambers was one cubit on this
ezk	40:13	He measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to
ezk	40:14	He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of
ezk	40:15	And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of
ezk	40:16	And there were narrow windows to the little chambers, and to
ezk	40:17	Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, there were
ezk	40:18	And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the
ezk	40:19	Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower
ezk	40:20	And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north,
ezk	40:21	And the little chambers thereof were three on this side and
ezk	40:22	And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, were
ezk	40:23	And the gate of the inner court was over against the gate toward
ezk	40:24	After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate
ezk	40:25	And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round
ezk	40:26	And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches
ezk	40:27	And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he
ezk	40:28	And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he
ezk	40:30	And the arches round about were five and twenty cubits long, and
ezk	40:31	And the arches thereof were toward the utter court; and palm
ezk	40:32	And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he
ezk	40:33	And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the
ezk	40:34	And the arches thereof were toward the outward court; and palm
ezk	40:35	And he brought me to the north gate, and measured it according
ezk	40:37	And the posts thereof were toward the utter court; and palm
ezk	40:38	And the chambers and the entries thereof were by the posts of
ezk	40:39	And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and
ezk	40:40	And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the
ezk	40:41	Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by
ezk	40:42	And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering,
ezk	40:43	And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and
ezk	40:44	And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in
ezk	40:45	And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the
ezk	40:46	And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the
ezk	40:47	So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred
ezk	40:48	And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each
ezk	40:49	The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth
ezk	41:1	Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts,
ezk	41:2	And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the
ezk	41:3	Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two
ezk	41:4	So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the
ezk	41:5	After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the
ezk	41:6	And the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty in
ezk	41:7	And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to
ezk	41:8	I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations
ezk	41:9	The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber
ezk	41:10	And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round
ezk	41:11	And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that
ezk	41:12	Now the building that was before the separate place at the end
ezk	41:13	So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the
ezk	41:15	And he measured the length of the building over against the
ezk	41:18	And it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm
ezk	41:20	From the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm
ezk	41:21	The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the
ezk	41:22	The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof
ezk	41:23	And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.
ezk	41:24	And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two
ezk	41:25	And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple,
ezk	41:26	And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and
ezk	42:1	Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the
ezk	42:2	Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door, and
ezk	42:3	Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court,
ezk	42:4	And before the chambers was a walk to ten cubits breadth inward,
ezk	42:5	Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were
ezk	42:6	For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the
ezk	42:7	And the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward
ezk	42:8	For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was
ezk	42:9	And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as
ezk	42:10	The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court
ezk	42:11	And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers
ezk	42:12	And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the
ezk	42:13	Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers,
ezk	42:14	When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of
ezk	42:15	Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he
ezk	42:16	He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred
ezk	42:17	He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the
ezk	42:18	He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the
ezk	42:19	He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred
ezk	42:20	He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about,
ezk	43:1	Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh
ezk	43:3	And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw,
ezk	43:4	And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the
ezk	43:5	So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court;
ezk	43:6	And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and the man
ezk	43:7	And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the
ezk	43:8	In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their
ezk	43:9	Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their
ezk	43:10	Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that
ezk	43:11	And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them the
ezk	43:12	This is the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the
ezk	43:13	And these are the measures of the altar after the cubits: The
ezk	43:14	And from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle
ezk	43:15	So the altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar and upward
ezk	43:16	And the altar shall be twelve cubits long, twelve broad, square
ezk	43:17	And the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad
ezk	43:18	And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; These
ezk	43:19	And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the
ezk	43:20	And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four
ezk	43:21	Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he
ezk	43:22	And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats
ezk	43:23	When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a
ezk	43:24	And thou shalt offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall
ezk	43:25	Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin
ezk	43:26	Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they
ezk	43:27	And when these days are expired, it shall be, that upon the
ezk	44:1	Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward
ezk	44:2	Then said the LORD unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not
ezk	44:3	It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread
ezk	44:4	Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house:
ezk	44:5	And the LORD said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with
ezk	44:6	And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of
ezk	44:8	And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye have
ezk	44:9	Thus saith the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor
ezk	44:10	And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went
ezk	44:11	Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at
ezk	44:12	Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused
ezk	44:13	And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a
ezk	44:14	But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all
ezk	44:15	But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the
ezk	44:17	And it shall come to pass, that when they enter in at the gates
ezk	44:18	They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have
ezk	44:19	And when they go forth into the utter court, even into the utter
ezk	44:20	Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to
ezk	44:21	Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the
ezk	44:22	Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is
ezk	44:23	And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy
ezk	44:24	And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; and they shall
ezk	44:25	And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves: but
ezk	44:26	And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days.
ezk	44:27	And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the inner
ezk	44:28	And it shall be unto them for an inheritance: I am their
ezk	44:29	They shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the
ezk	44:30	And the first of all the firstfruits of all things, and every
ezk	44:31	The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself,
ezk	45:1	Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance,
ezk	45:2	Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length,
ezk	45:3	And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and
ezk	45:4	The holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the
ezk	45:5	And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand
ezk	45:6	And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand
ezk	45:7	And a portion shall be for the prince on the one side and on the
ezk	45:8	In the land shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes
ezk	45:9	Thus saith the Lord GOD; Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel:
ezk	45:10	Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.
ezk	45:11	The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath
ezk	45:12	And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and
ezk	45:13	This is the oblation that ye shall offer; the sixth part of an
ezk	45:16	All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the
ezk	45:17	And it shall be the prince’s part to give burnt offerings, and
ezk	45:18	Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the first month, in the first day of
ezk	45:20	And so thou shalt do the seventh day of the month for every one
ezk	45:21	In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall
ezk	45:22	And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for
ezk	45:23	And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to
ezk	45:24	And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock,
ezk	45:25	In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, shall
ezk	46:1	Thus saith the Lord GOD; The gate of the inner court that looketh
ezk	46:2	And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate
ezk	46:3	Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this
ezk	46:4	And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the LORD
ezk	46:5	And the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram, and the meat
ezk	46:6	And in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock
ezk	46:7	And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock, and
ezk	46:8	And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the
ezk	46:9	But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in the
ezk	46:10	And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go
ezk	46:11	And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall
ezk	46:12	Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or
ezk	46:13	Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the LORD of a
ezk	46:14	And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning, the
ezk	46:15	Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the
ezk	46:16	Thus saith the Lord GOD; If the prince give a gift unto any of
ezk	46:17	But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants,
ezk	46:18	Moreover the prince shall not take of the people’s inheritance
ezk	46:19	After he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of
ezk	46:20	Then said he unto me, This is the place where the priests shall
ezk	46:21	Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to

ezk	46:23	And there was a row of building round about in them, round about
ezk	46:24	Then said he unto me, These are the places of them that boil,
ezk	47:1	Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and,
ezk	47:2	Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led
ezk	47:3	And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth
ezk	47:4	Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters;
ezk	47:5	Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could

ezk	47:7	Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were
ezk	47:8	Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the east
ezk	47:9	And it shall come to pass, that every thing that liveth, which

ezk	47:11	But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not

dan	2:23	I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast
dan	2:24	Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained
dan	2:25	Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said
dan	2:26	The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was
dan	2:30	But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom
dan	2:31	Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image,
dan	2:32	This image’s head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of
dan	2:34	Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which
dan	2:35	Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold,
dan	2:36	This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof
dan	2:37	Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath
dan	2:38	And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the
dan	2:39	And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and
dan	2:40	And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron
dan	2:41	And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay,
dan	2:42	And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay,
dan	2:43	And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall
dan	2:44	And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a
dan	2:45	Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the
dan	2:46	Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped
dan	2:47	The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that
dan	2:48	Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great
dan	2:49	Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach,
dan	3:1	Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was
dan	3:2	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes,
dan	3:3	Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the
dan	3:4	Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people,
dan	3:7	Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the
dan	3:8	Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused
dan	3:9	They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for
dan	3:10	Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear
dan	3:11	And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be
dan	3:12	There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the
dan	3:13	Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring
dan	3:14	Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach,
dan	3:17	If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the
dan	3:18	But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve
dan	3:19	Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage
dan	3:20	And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to
dan	3:21	Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their
dan	3:22	Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the
dan	3:23	And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down
dan	3:24	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste,
dan	3:25	He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the
dan	3:26	Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery
dan	3:27	And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king’s
dan	3:28	Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of
dan	3:29	Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and
dan	3:30	Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the
dan	4:1	Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages,
dan	4:2	I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God
dan	4:3	How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his
dan	4:4	I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my
dan	4:6	Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon
dan	4:7	Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and
dan	4:8	But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was
dan	4:10	Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a
dan	4:11	The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached
dan	4:13	I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a
dan	4:17	This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by
dan	4:18	This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O
dan	4:19	Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one
dan	4:20	The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose
dan	4:23	And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down
dan	4:26	And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots;
dan	4:27	Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and
dan	4:28	All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.
dan	4:29	At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the
dan	4:30	The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have
dan	4:32	And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be
dan	4:33	The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he
dan	4:34	And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes
dan	4:37	Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of
dan	5:1	Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords,
dan	5:2	Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the
dan	5:3	Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the
dan	5:4	They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of

dan	5:6	Then the king’s countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled
dan	5:7	The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans,
dan	5:8	Then came in all the king’s wise men: but they could not read the
dan	5:9	Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was
dan	5:10	Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords
dan	5:13	Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake
dan	5:15	And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in
dan	5:17	Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be
dan	5:18	O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a
dan	5:20	But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride,
dan	5:22	And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart,
dan	5:25	And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL,
dan	5:26	This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered
dan	5:27	TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.
dan	5:28	PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and
dan	5:29	Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet,
dan	5:30	In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.
dan	5:31	And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore
dan	6:1	It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty
dan	6:3	Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes,
dan	6:4	Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against
dan	6:5	Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this
dan	6:6	Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king,
dan	6:7	All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes,
dan	6:8	Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it
dan	6:9	Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.
dan	6:10	Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into
dan	6:11	Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making
dan	6:12	Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the
dan	6:13	Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which
dan	6:14	Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased
dan	6:15	Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king,
dan	6:16	Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him
dan	6:17	And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and
dan	6:18	Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting:
dan	6:19	Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste
dan	6:20	And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice
dan	6:22	My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths, that
dan	6:23	Then was the king exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that
dan	6:24	And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had
dan	6:25	Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages,
dan	6:26	I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble
dan	6:27	He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in
dan	6:28	So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign
dan	7:1	In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream
dan	7:2	Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold,
dan	7:3	And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from
dan	7:4	The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings: I beheld till
dan	7:5	And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised
dan	7:6	After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had
dan	7:7	After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast,
dan	7:8	I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them
dan	7:9	I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days
dan	7:10	A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand
dan	7:11	I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the
dan	7:12	As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion
dan	7:13	I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man
dan	7:14	And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that
dan	7:15	I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and
dan	7:16	I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the
dan	7:17	These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall
dan	7:18	But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and
dan	7:19	Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was
dan	7:21	I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and
dan	7:23	Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon
dan	7:24	And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall
dan	7:25	And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall
dan	7:26	But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his
dan	7:27	And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom
dan	7:28	Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my
dan	8:1	In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision
dan	8:2	And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was
dan	8:3	Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood
dan	8:4	I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so
dan	8:5	And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on
dan	8:6	And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen
dan	8:7	And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with
dan	8:8	Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong,
dan	8:9	And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed
dan	8:10	And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down
dan	8:11	Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by
dan	8:12	And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason
dan	8:13	Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that
dan	8:15	And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision,
dan	8:16	And I heard a man’s voice between the banks of Ulai, which
dan	8:17	So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid,
dan	8:18	Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face
dan	8:19	And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the
dan	8:20	The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media
dan	8:21	And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that
dan	8:22	Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four
dan	8:23	And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors
dan	8:24	And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he
dan	8:25	And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in
dan	8:26	And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is
dan	8:27	And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose
dan	9:1	In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of
dan	9:3	And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and
dan	9:6	Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which
dan	9:7	O LORD, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion
dan	9:8	O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our
dan	9:9	To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we
dan	9:11	Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing,
dan	9:12	And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and
dan	9:13	As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon
dan	9:14	Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it
dan	9:15	And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out
dan	9:16	O LORD, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let
dan	9:17	Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his
dan	9:18	O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and
dan	9:19	O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not,
dan	9:20	And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and
dan	9:22	And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am
dan	9:23	At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth,
dan	9:24	Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy
dan	9:25	Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the
dan	9:26	And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but
dan	9:27	And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in
dan	10:1	In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed
dan	10:2	In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.
dan	10:3	I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth,
dan	10:4	And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by
dan	10:7	And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me
dan	10:8	Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there
dan	10:9	Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of
dan	10:10	And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and
dan	10:11	And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand
dan	10:12	Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day
dan	10:13	But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and
dan	10:14	Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy
dan	10:15	And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward
dan	10:16	And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched
dan	10:17	For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord?
dan	10:18	Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of
dan	10:20	Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now
dan	10:21	But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of
dan	11:1	Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to
dan	11:2	And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up
dan	11:3	And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great
dan	11:4	And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and
dan	11:5	And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his
dan	11:6	And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for
dan	11:7	But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his
dan	11:9	So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall
dan	11:10	But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude
dan	11:11	And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall
dan	11:12	And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be
dan	11:13	For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a
dan	11:14	And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of
dan	11:15	So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and
dan	11:16	But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own
dan	11:17	He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his
dan	11:18	After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take
dan	11:19	Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but
dan	11:20	Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory
dan	11:21	And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they
dan	11:22	And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before
dan	11:23	And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully:
dan	11:24	He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the
dan	11:25	And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king
dan	11:26	Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy
dan	11:27	And both of these kings’ hearts shall be to do mischief, and
dan	11:28	Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his
dan	11:29	At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the
dan	11:30	For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he
dan	11:31	And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the
dan	11:32	And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by
dan	11:33	And they that understand among the people shall instruct many:
dan	11:34	Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little
dan	11:35	And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and
dan	11:36	And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt
dan	11:37	Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire
dan	11:38	But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god
dan	11:39	Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god,
dan	11:40	And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at
dan	11:41	He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries
dan	11:42	He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the
dan	11:43	But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of
dan	11:44	But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble
dan	11:45	And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the
dan	12:1	And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which
dan	12:2	And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake,
dan	12:3	And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the
dan	12:4	But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to
dan	12:5	Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one
dan	12:6	And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the
dan	12:7	And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters
dan	12:8	And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what
dan	12:10	Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the
dan	12:11	And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away,
dan	12:12	Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three

hos	1:1	The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in
hos	1:2	The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said
hos	1:3	So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which
hos	1:4	And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a
hos	1:5	And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow
hos	1:6	And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said unto
hos	1:7	But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them
hos	1:8	Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.
hos	1:9	Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for ye are not my people, and
hos	1:10	Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of
hos	1:11	Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be

hos	2:2	Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither am
hos	2:4	And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the
hos	2:5	For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them
hos	2:6	Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a

hos	2:8	For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and
hos	2:9	Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time
hos	2:10	And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers,
hos	2:11	I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new
hos	2:12	And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath
hos	2:13	And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned
hos	2:14	Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the
hos	2:15	And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of
hos	2:16	And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt call
hos	2:17	For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and

hos	3:2	So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an

hos	5:2	And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I have
hos	5:3	I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim,

zec	10:12	And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up
zec	11:1	Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.
zec	11:2	Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are
zec	11:3	There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory
zec	11:4	Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter; 11:5
zec	11:6	For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the
zec	11:7	And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the
zec	11:8	Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed
zec	11:9	Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die;
zec	11:10	And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I

zec	11:12	And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if
zec	11:13	And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly
zec	11:14	Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might
zec	11:15	And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of

zec	12:2	Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the
zec	12:3	And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all
zec	12:4	In that day, saith the LORD, I will smite every horse with
zec	12:5	And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The
zec	12:6	In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of

zec	12:8	In that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
zec	12:9	And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to

zec	12:12	And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the

zec	14:3	Then shall the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations, as
zec	14:4	And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives,

mal	1:2	I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou
mal	1:4	Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and
mal	1:5	And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be
mal	1:6	A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be
mal	1:8	And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye
mal	1:9	And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us:
mal	1:10	Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought?
mal	1:11	For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the
mal	1:12	But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD is
mal	1:13	Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed
mal	1:14	But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and
mal	2:1	And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you.
mal	2:2	If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give
mal	2:3	Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces,
mal	2:4	And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that
mal	2:5	My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him
mal	2:6	The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in
mal	2:7	For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek
mal	2:8	But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble
mal	2:9	Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all
mal	2:10	Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do
mal	2:12	The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the
mal	2:13	And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the LORD with
mal	2:14	Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath been witness between
mal	2:15	And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit.
mal	2:16	For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting
mal	2:17	Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein
mal	3:2	But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when
mal	3:3	And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall
mal	3:4	Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto
mal	3:5	And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift
mal	3:6	For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are
mal	3:7	Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine
mal	3:9	Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole
mal	3:10	Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be
mal	3:11	And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not
mal	3:12	And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a
mal	3:13	Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye
mal	3:16	Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and
mal	3:17	And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day when
mal	3:18	Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the
mal	4:1	For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all
mal	4:2	But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness
mal	4:3	And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under
mal	4:4	Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto
mal	4:5	Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of
mat	1:1	The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the
mat	1:2	Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas
mat	1:10	And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon
mat	1:17	So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen
mat	1:18	Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his
mat	1:19	Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to
mat	1:20	But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the
mat	1:21	And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name
mat	1:22	Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was
mat	1:24	Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord
mat	2:1	Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of
mat	2:3	When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and
mat	2:4	And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the
mat	2:5	And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is
mat	2:7	Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of
mat	2:8	And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently
mat	2:9	When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star,
mat	2:10	When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
mat	2:11	And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child
mat	2:12	And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to
mat	2:13	And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord
mat	2:14	When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night,
mat	2:16	Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was
mat	2:17	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet,
mat	2:19	But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth
mat	2:21	And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came
mat	2:22	But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room
mat	3:1	In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness
mat	3:3	For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying,
mat	3:4	And the same John had his raiment of camel’s hair, and a leathern
mat	3:5	Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region
mat	3:7	But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his
mat	3:10	And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees:
mat	3:11	I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance. but he that
mat	3:13	Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be
mat	3:14	But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee,
mat	3:16	And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the
mat	4:1	Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be
mat	4:2	And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was
mat	4:3	And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of
mat	4:4	But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by
mat	4:5	Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him
mat	4:7	Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the
mat	4:8	Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain,
mat	4:9	And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou
mat	4:10	Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is
mat	4:11	Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and
mat	4:12	Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he
mat	4:17	From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the
mat	4:18	And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon
mat	4:19	And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of
mat	4:20	And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.
mat	4:21	And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the
mat	4:22	And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed
mat	4:23	And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues,
mat	4:24	And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him
mat	4:25	And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee,
mat	5:1	And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he
mat	5:4	Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
mat	5:5	Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
mat	5:6	Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness:
mat	5:7	Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
mat	5:8	Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
mat	5:9	Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children
mat	5:10	Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake:
mat	5:11	Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and
mat	5:12	Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in
mat	5:13	Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his
mat	5:14	Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill
mat	5:15	Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on
mat	5:16	Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good
mat	5:17	Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I
mat	5:18	For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or
mat	5:19	Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments,
mat	5:20	For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed
mat	5:21	Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt
mat	5:22	But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother
mat	5:23	Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there
mat	5:25	Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way
mat	5:26	Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence,
mat	5:27	Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt
mat	5:29	And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from
mat	5:30	And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from
mat	5:31	It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him
mat	5:33	Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time,
mat	5:36	Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make
mat	5:37	But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever
mat	5:38	Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a
mat	5:40	And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat,
mat	5:41	And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.
mat	5:42	Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of
mat	5:43	Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy
mat	5:44	But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you,
mat	5:46	For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not
mat	6:1	Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them:
mat	6:2	Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet
mat	6:3	But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy
mat	6:5	And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are:
mat	6:6	But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou
mat	6:7	But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for
mat	6:8	Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what
mat	6:9	After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in
mat	6:10	Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
mat	6:11	Give us this day our daily bread.
mat	6:12	And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
mat	6:13	And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For
mat	6:14	For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will
mat	6:16	Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad
mat	6:17	But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy
mat	6:19	Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and
mat	6:22	The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be
mat	6:23	But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of
mat	6:25	Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye
mat	6:30	Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day
mat	6:33	But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and
mat	6:34	Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall
mat	7:1	Judge not, that ye be not judged.
mat	7:2	For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what
mat	7:3	And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but
mat	7:6	Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your
mat	7:7	Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock,
mat	7:9	Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he
mat	7:13	Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad
mat	7:15	Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing,
mat	7:16	Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of
mat	7:18	A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt
mat	7:19	Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and
mat	7:20	Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.
mat	7:21	Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into
mat	7:22	Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not
mat	7:24	Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth
mat	7:26	And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them
mat	7:28	And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the
mat	8:1	When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed
mat	8:2	And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord,
mat	8:3	And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be
mat	8:4	And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way,
mat	8:5	And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a
mat	8:7	And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.
mat	8:8	The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou
mat	8:9	For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I
mat	8:10	When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that
mat	8:11	And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west,
mat	8:12	But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer
mat	8:13	And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast
mat	8:14	And when Jesus was come into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s
mat	8:15	And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose,
mat	8:16	When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were
mat	8:18	Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave
mat	8:19	And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will
mat	8:20	And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of
mat	8:21	And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first
mat	8:22	But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their
mat	8:23	And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.
mat	8:24	And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch
mat	8:25	And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save
mat	8:26	And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?
mat	8:27	But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that
mat	8:29	And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with
mat	8:31	So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer
mat	8:32	And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went
mat	8:33	And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city,
mat	8:34	And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they
mat	9:1	And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own
mat	9:2	And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on
mat	9:3	And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This
mat	9:4	And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in
mat	9:7	And he arose, and departed to his house.
mat	9:8	But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God,
mat	9:9	And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named
mat	9:10	And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold,
mat	9:11	And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why
mat	9:13	But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not
mat	9:14	Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the
mat	9:16	No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that
mat	9:17	Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles
mat	9:18	While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a
mat	9:19	And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.
mat	9:20	And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood
mat	9:21	For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I
mat	9:22	But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said,
mat	9:23	And when Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw the minstrels
mat	9:25	But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by
mat	9:26	And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.
mat	9:27	And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him,
mat	9:28	And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him:
mat	9:29	Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it
mat	9:30	And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them,
mat	9:31	But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all
mat	9:32	As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man
mat	9:33	And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the
mat	9:34	But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince
mat	9:35	And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in
mat	9:36	But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on
mat	9:37	Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous,
mat	10:1	And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave
mat	10:2	Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon,
mat	10:5	These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not
mat	10:7	And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
mat	10:8	Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out
mat	10:9	Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, 10:10
mat	10:11	And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in
mat	10:12	And when ye come into an house, salute it.
mat	10:13	And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if
mat	10:14	And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when
mat	10:15	Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land
mat	10:16	Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye
mat	10:17	But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils,
mat	10:19	But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye
mat	10:20	For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which
mat	10:21	And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the
mat	10:22	And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that
mat	10:23	But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another:
mat	10:24	The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his
mat	10:25	It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the
mat	10:27	What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye
mat	10:28	And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill
mat	10:29	Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall
mat	10:30	But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
mat	10:31	Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.
mat	10:32	Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I
mat	10:33	But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny
mat	10:34	Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to
mat	10:35	For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and
mat	10:36	And a man’s foes shall be they of his own household.
mat	10:37	He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of
mat	10:38	And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not
mat	10:39	He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his
mat	10:40	He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me
mat	10:41	He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall
mat	10:42	And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones
mat	11:1	And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his
mat	11:2	Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he
mat	11:6	And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.
mat	11:7	And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes
mat	11:9	But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you,
mat	11:10	For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my
mat	11:11	Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there
mat	11:12	And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of
mat	11:13	For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
mat	11:14	And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.
mat	11:15	He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
mat	11:16	But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto
mat	11:18	For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath
mat	11:19	The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a
mat	11:20	Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty
mat	11:22	But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and
mat	11:23	And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be
mat	11:24	But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land
mat	11:25	At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father,
mat	11:26	Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.
mat	11:27	All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man
mat	11:28	Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will
mat	11:29	Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly
mat	11:30	For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
mat	12:1	At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and
mat	12:2	But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy
mat	12:3	But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he
mat	12:6	But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the
mat	12:7	But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not
mat	12:8	For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.
mat	12:9	And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:
mat	12:10	And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And
mat	12:11	And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that
mat	12:13	Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he
mat	12:14	Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how
mat	12:15	But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and
mat	12:19	He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his
mat	12:20	A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not
mat	12:21	And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.
mat	12:22	Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and
mat	12:23	And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of
mat	12:25	And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom
mat	12:28	But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom
mat	12:29	Or else how can one enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil
mat	12:30	He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not
mat	12:31	Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall
mat	12:32	And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall
mat	12:33	Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the
mat	12:34	O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good
mat	12:35	A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth
mat	12:36	But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,
mat	12:37	For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou
mat	12:38	Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered,
mat	12:39	But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous
mat	12:41	The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation,
mat	12:42	The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this
mat	12:43	When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through
mat	12:44	Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came
mat	12:45	Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more
mat	12:46	While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his
mat	12:47	Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren
mat	12:48	But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my
mat	12:50	For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven,
mat	13:1	The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea
mat	13:2	And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he
mat	13:3	And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a
mat	13:7	And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked
mat	13:9	Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
mat	13:10	And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou
mat	13:12	For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have
mat	13:13	Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see
mat	13:14	And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By
mat	13:16	But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they
mat	13:17	For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men
mat	13:18	Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.
mat	13:19	When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth
mat	13:20	But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he
mat	13:22	He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth
mat	13:23	But he that received seed into the good ground is he that
mat	13:24	Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of
mat	13:26	But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then
mat	13:27	So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir,
mat	13:30	Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of
mat	13:31	Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of
mat	13:33	Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is
mat	13:34	All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and
mat	13:36	Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and
mat	13:37	He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is
mat	13:40	As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so
mat	13:41	The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall
mat	13:43	Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom
mat	13:44	Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a
mat	13:45	Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man,
mat	13:47	Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast
mat	13:49	So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come
mat	13:51	Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They
mat	13:52	Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is
mat	13:53	And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these
mat	13:54	And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in
mat	13:57	And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A
mat	13:58	And he did not many mighty works there because of their
mat	14:1	At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus, 14:2
mat	14:3	For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in
mat	14:4	For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.
mat	14:5	And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude,
mat	14:6	But when Herod’s birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias
mat	14:7	Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she
mat	14:8	And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me
mat	14:9	And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath’s sake, and
mat	14:10	And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.
mat	14:11	And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel:
mat	14:12	And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and
mat	14:13	When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert
mat	14:14	And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved
mat	14:15	And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This
mat	14:16	But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to
mat	14:17	And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two
mat	14:18	He said, Bring them hither to me.
mat	14:19	And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and
mat	14:20	And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the
mat	14:21	And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside
mat	14:22	And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a
mat	14:23	And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a
mat	14:24	But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves:
mat	14:25	And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them,
mat	14:26	And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were
mat	14:27	But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer;
mat	14:28	And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me
mat	14:29	And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship,
mat	14:30	But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and
mat	14:31	And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him,
mat	14:32	And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.
mat	14:33	Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying,
mat	14:34	And when they were gone over, they came into the land of
mat	14:35	And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent
mat	15:1	Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of
mat	15:3	But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the
mat	15:5	But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It
mat	15:7	Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, 15:8 This
mat	15:9	But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the
mat	15:10	And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and
mat	15:12	Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that
mat	15:14	Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the
mat	15:15	Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this
mat	15:16	And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding? 15:17 Do
mat	15:19	For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,
mat	15:21	Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and
mat	15:22	And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and
mat	15:23	But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and
mat	15:24	But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep
mat	15:25	Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.
mat	15:26	But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s
mat	15:27	And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which
mat	15:28	Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy
mat	15:29	And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of
mat	15:30	And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that
mat	15:32	Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have
mat	15:33	And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much
mat	15:35	And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.
mat	15:36	And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks,
mat	15:37	And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the
mat	15:38	And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and
mat	15:39	And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the
mat	16:1	The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired
mat	16:2	He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It
mat	16:3	And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky
mat	16:5	And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had
mat	16:6	Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of
mat	16:7	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have
mat	16:8	Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little
mat	16:13	When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked
mat	16:14	And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some,
mat	16:15	He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? 16:16 And Simon
mat	16:17	And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon
mat	16:18	And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this
mat	16:19	And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and
mat	16:20	Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that
mat	16:21	From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how
mat	16:22	Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far
mat	16:23	But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan:
mat	16:24	Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after
mat	16:25	For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever
mat	16:26	For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world,
mat	16:28	Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall
mat	17:1	And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his
mat	17:3	And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking
mat	17:4	Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us
mat	17:5	While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and
mat	17:6	And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and
mat	17:7	And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not
mat	17:8	And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save
mat	17:9	And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them,
mat	17:10	And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes
mat	17:12	But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew
mat	17:13	Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John
mat	17:14	And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a
mat	17:16	And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.
mat	17:17	Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse
mat	17:18	And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the
mat	17:19	Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not
mat	17:21	Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.
mat	17:22	And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son
mat	17:24	And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute
mat	17:25	He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus
mat	17:27	Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea,
mat	18:1	At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is
mat	18:4	Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child,
mat	18:5	And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name
mat	18:6	But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in
mat	18:7	Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that
mat	18:9	And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from
mat	18:10	Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I
mat	18:11	For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.
mat	18:12	How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be
mat	18:14	Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven,
mat	18:15	Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell
mat	18:16	But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two
mat	18:17	And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church:
mat	18:18	Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall
mat	18:19	Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as
mat	18:20	For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there
mat	18:21	Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother
mat	18:23	Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king,
mat	18:24	And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which
mat	18:25	But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be
mat	18:26	The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying,
mat	18:27	Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and
mat	18:28	But the same servant went out, and found one of his
mat	18:29	And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him,
mat	18:30	And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he
mat	18:31	So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very
mat	18:32	Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O
mat	18:35	So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye
mat	19:1	And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings,
mat	19:3	The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto
mat	19:4	And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he
mat	19:7	They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing
mat	19:9	And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it
mat	19:10	His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with
mat	19:11	But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save
mat	19:12	For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their
mat	19:13	Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should
mat	19:14	But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to
mat	19:15	And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.
mat	19:16	And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good
mat	19:18	He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder,
mat	19:20	The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from
mat	19:22	But when the young man heard that saying, he went away
mat	19:23	Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That
mat	19:24	And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through
mat	19:25	When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed,
mat	19:27	Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken
mat	19:29	And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or
mat	19:30	But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be
mat	20:1	For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an
mat	20:2	And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he
mat	20:3	And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing
mat	20:5	Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did
mat	20:6	And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others
mat	20:8	So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his
mat	20:9	And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they
mat	20:10	But when the first came, they supposed that they should have
mat	20:11	And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman
mat	20:13	But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no
mat	20:15	Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is
mat	20:17	And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart
mat	20:20	Then came to him the mother of Zebedee’s children with her sons,
mat	20:21	And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant
mat	20:22	But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye
mat	20:23	And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be
mat	20:24	And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation
mat	20:25	But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the
mat	20:26	But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great
mat	20:29	And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed
mat	20:30	And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they
mat	20:31	And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their
mat	20:32	And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye
mat	20:34	So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and
mat	21:1	And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to
mat	21:2	Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and
mat	21:3	And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath
mat	21:4	All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by
mat	21:6	And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them, 21:7 And
mat	21:8	And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way;
mat	21:9	And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried,
mat	21:10	And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved,
mat	21:12	And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them
mat	21:14	And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he
mat	21:15	And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things
mat	21:18	Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.
mat	21:19	And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found
mat	21:20	And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon
mat	21:22	And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye
mat	21:23	And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the
mat	21:25	The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And
mat	21:27	And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said
mat	21:28	But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to
mat	21:29	He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and
mat	21:30	And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered
mat	21:31	Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto
mat	21:32	For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye
mat	21:33	Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which
mat	21:35	And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed
mat	21:36	Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did
mat	21:37	But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will
mat	21:38	But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves,
mat	21:39	And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew
mat	21:40	When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do
mat	21:42	Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The
mat	21:43	Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from
mat	21:44	And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on
mat	21:45	And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables,
mat	21:46	But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the
mat	22:1	And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and
mat	22:4	Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are
mat	22:5	But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm,
mat	22:7	But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth
mat	22:8	Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they
mat	22:9	Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find,
mat	22:10	So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered
mat	22:11	And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man
mat	22:13	Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and
mat	22:14	For many are called, but few are chosen.
mat	22:15	Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might
mat	22:16	And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians,
mat	22:17	Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give
mat	22:20	And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?
mat	22:21	They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he unto them, Render
mat	22:22	When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him,
mat	22:23	The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is
mat	22:25	Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he
mat	22:27	And last of all the woman died also.
mat	22:28	Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the
mat	22:29	Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the
mat	22:30	For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in
mat	22:31	But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read
mat	22:33	And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his
mat	22:34	But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees
mat	22:35	Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question,
mat	22:38	This is the first and great commandment.
mat	22:39	And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
mat	22:40	On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
mat	22:41	While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,
mat	22:42	Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto
mat	22:43	He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord,
mat	23:1	Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, 23:2
mat	23:4	For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay
mat	23:5	But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make
mat	23:6	And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in
mat	23:8	But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ;
mat	23:9	And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your
mat	23:10	Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even
mat	23:11	But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.
mat	23:12	And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that
mat	23:13	But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut
mat	23:14	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour
mat	23:15	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass
mat	23:16	Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear
mat	23:19	Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the
mat	23:21	And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him
mat	23:22	And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of
mat	23:23	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay
mat	23:24	Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.
mat	23:25	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make
mat	23:26	Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup
mat	23:27	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like
mat	23:28	Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within
mat	23:29	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye
mat	23:31	Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the
mat	23:32	Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.
mat	23:33	Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the
mat	23:36	Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this
mat	23:37	O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and
mat	23:39	For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye
mat	24:1	And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his
mat	24:2	And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I
mat	24:3	And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto
mat	24:5	For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall
mat	24:6	And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not
mat	24:7	For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against
mat	24:8	All these are the beginning of sorrows.
mat	24:9	Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill
mat	24:10	And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another,
mat	24:11	And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.
mat	24:12	And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax
mat	24:13	But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
mat	24:14	And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
mat	24:15	When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation,
mat	24:19	And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give
mat	24:22	And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh
mat	24:23	Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or
mat	24:24	For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and
mat	24:25	Behold, I have told you before.
mat	24:26	Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the
mat	24:27	For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even
mat	24:28	For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be
mat	24:29	Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be
mat	24:31	And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet,
mat	24:32	Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet
mat	24:34	Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all
mat	24:35	Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass
mat	24:36	But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of
mat	24:37	But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son
mat	24:38	For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating
mat	24:40	Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the
mat	24:41	Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken,
mat	24:42	Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.
mat	24:43	But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in
mat	24:44	Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not
mat	24:45	Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made
mat	24:47	Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his
mat	24:48	But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord
mat	25:1	Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins,
mat	25:2	And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
mat	25:3	They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with
mat	25:5	While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
mat	25:6	And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom
mat	25:7	Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
mat	25:8	And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our
mat	25:9	But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough
mat	25:10	And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that
mat	25:11	Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open
mat	25:12	But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.
mat	25:13	Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour
mat	25:14	For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far
mat	25:15	And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to
mat	25:16	Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with
mat	25:17	And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.
mat	25:18	But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and
mat	25:19	After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and
mat	25:20	And so he that had received five talents came and brought other
mat	25:21	His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful
mat	25:22	He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou
mat	25:23	His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant;
mat	25:24	Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I
mat	25:26	His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful
mat	25:28	Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which
mat	25:29	For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have
mat	25:30	And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there
mat	25:31	When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy
mat	25:34	Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye
mat	25:37	Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we
mat	25:41	Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from
mat	25:44	Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee
mat	25:46	And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the
mat	26:1	And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings,
mat	26:3	Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and
mat	26:5	But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar
mat	26:6	Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
mat	26:7	There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very
mat	26:8	But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To
mat	26:10	When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the
mat	26:11	For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.
mat	26:12	For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it
mat	26:13	Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached
mat	26:14	Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the
mat	26:16	And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.
mat	26:17	Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples
mat	26:19	And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made
mat	26:20	Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.
mat	26:21	And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of
mat	26:22	And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them
mat	26:24	The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that
mat	26:25	Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it
mat	26:26	And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and
mat	26:27	And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them,
mat	26:29	But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of
mat	26:30	And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of
mat	26:31	Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of
mat	26:32	But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.
mat	26:33	Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be
mat	26:34	Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night,
mat	26:35	Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I
mat	26:36	Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and
mat	26:37	And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and
mat	26:38	Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even
mat	26:39	And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed,
mat	26:40	And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and
mat	26:42	He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my
mat	26:43	And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were
mat	26:44	And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third
mat	26:45	Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on
mat	26:46	Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray
mat	26:47	And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and
mat	26:48	Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I
mat	26:49	And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and
mat	26:50	And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then
mat	26:51	And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his
mat	26:52	Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place:
mat	26:53	Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall
mat	26:56	But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might
mat	26:57	And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas
mat	26:58	But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest’s palace,
mat	26:59	Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought
mat	26:62	And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou
mat	26:64	Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto
mat	26:65	Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken
mat	26:66	What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.
mat	26:67	Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others
mat	26:70	But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou
mat	26:71	And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him,
mat	26:72	And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.
mat	26:73	And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to
mat	26:74	Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man.
mat	26:75	And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him,
mat	27:1	When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of
mat	27:3	Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was
mat	27:5	And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and
mat	27:6	And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not
mat	27:7	And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field,
mat	27:8	Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this
mat	27:9	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet,
mat	27:11	And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him,
mat	27:12	And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he
mat	27:13	Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they
mat	27:15	Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the
mat	27:16	And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.
mat	27:17	Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto
mat	27:19	When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto
mat	27:20	But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that
mat	27:21	The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain
mat	27:22	Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is
mat	27:23	And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they
mat	27:24	When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a
mat	27:25	Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and
mat	27:26	Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged
mat	27:27	Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common
mat	27:28	And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.
mat	27:29	And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon
mat	27:31	And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from
mat	27:32	And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name:
mat	27:33	And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to
mat	27:35	And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots:
mat	27:36	And sitting down they watched him there; 27:37 And set up over
mat	27:38	Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right
mat	27:39	And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads, 27:40
mat	27:41	Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes
mat	27:43	He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him:
mat	27:44	The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same
mat	27:45	Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land
mat	27:46	And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
mat	27:48	And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled
mat	27:49	The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to
mat	27:50	Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the
mat	27:51	And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the
mat	27:54	Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching
mat	27:55	And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed
mat	27:57	When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea,
mat	27:59	And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean
mat	27:61	And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over
mat	27:62	Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the
mat	27:64	Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the
mat	27:65	Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as
mat	27:66	So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone,
mat	28:1	In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first
mat	28:2	And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the
mat	28:3	His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as
mat	28:5	And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for
mat	28:6	He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place
mat	28:7	And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the
mat	28:8	And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great
mat	28:9	And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them,
mat	28:10	Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren
mat	28:11	Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into
mat	28:12	And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken
mat	28:14	And if this come to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him,
mat	28:15	So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this
mat	28:16	Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a
mat	28:17	And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.
mat	28:18	And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given
mat	28:19	Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the
mrk	1:1	The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God; 1:2
mrk	1:3	The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of
mrk	1:4	John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of
mrk	1:5	And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of
mrk	1:6	And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and with a girdle of a
mrk	1:8	I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you
mrk	1:9	And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth
mrk	1:10	And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens
mrk	1:12	And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness.
mrk	1:13	And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan;
mrk	1:14	Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee,
mrk	1:16	Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew
mrk	1:17	And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you
mrk	1:18	And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.
mrk	1:19	And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the
mrk	1:20	And straightway he called them: and they left their father
mrk	1:21	And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day
mrk	1:22	And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as
mrk	1:23	And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit;
mrk	1:25	And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of
mrk	1:26	And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud
mrk	1:27	And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among
mrk	1:28	And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region
mrk	1:29	And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they
mrk	1:30	But Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell
mrk	1:31	And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and
mrk	1:32	And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that
mrk	1:33	And all the city was gathered together at the door.
mrk	1:34	And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast
mrk	1:35	And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went
mrk	1:36	And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.
mrk	1:37	And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for
mrk	1:38	And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may
mrk	1:39	And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and
mrk	1:40	And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down
mrk	1:41	And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched
mrk	1:42	And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed
mrk	1:43	And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away; 1:44
mrk	1:45	But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze
mrk	2:1	And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was
mrk	2:2	And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there
mrk	2:3	And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was
mrk	2:4	And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they
mrk	2:5	When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy,
mrk	2:6	But there was certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning
mrk	2:12	And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before
mrk	2:13	And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude
mrk	2:14	And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at
mrk	2:15	And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house,
mrk	2:16	And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and
mrk	2:18	And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and
mrk	2:20	But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away
mrk	2:21	No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else
mrk	2:22	And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine
mrk	2:23	And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the
mrk	2:24	And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the
mrk	3:1	And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there
mrk	3:2	And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath
mrk	3:3	And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand
mrk	3:4	And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath
mrk	3:5	And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being
mrk	3:6	And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with
mrk	3:7	But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a
mrk	3:9	And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on
mrk	3:10	For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for
mrk	3:11	And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and
mrk	3:12	And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.
mrk	3:13	And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he
mrk	3:14	And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he
mrk	3:17	And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and
mrk	3:19	And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into
mrk	3:20	And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not
mrk	3:21	And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on
mrk	3:22	And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath
mrk	3:23	And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How
mrk	3:25	And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot
mrk	3:26	And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot
mrk	3:27	No man can enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil his goods,
mrk	3:28	Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons
mrk	3:30	Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.
mrk	3:31	There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing
mrk	3:32	And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold,
mrk	3:33	And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?
mrk	3:34	And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said,
mrk	4:1	And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was
mrk	4:2	And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in
mrk	4:5	And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and
mrk	4:7	And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it,
mrk	4:8	And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up
mrk	4:9	And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
mrk	4:10	And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve
mrk	4:11	And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery
mrk	4:13	And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then
mrk	4:15	And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but
mrk	4:16	And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who,
mrk	4:17	And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time:
mrk	4:18	And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the
mrk	4:20	And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear
mrk	4:21	And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a
mrk	4:23	If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
mrk	4:24	And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure
mrk	4:25	For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not,
mrk	4:26	And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast
mrk	4:28	For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade,
mrk	4:29	But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in
mrk	4:30	And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with
mrk	4:33	And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they
mrk	4:34	But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were
mrk	4:35	And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let
mrk	4:36	And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as
mrk	4:37	And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into
mrk	4:38	And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow:
mrk	4:40	And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye
mrk	5:2	And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him
mrk	5:5	And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the
mrk	5:6	But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him, 5:7 And
mrk	5:8	For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.
mrk	5:9	And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My
mrk	5:10	And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of
mrk	5:11	Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine
mrk	5:12	And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine,
mrk	5:13	And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went
mrk	5:14	And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in
mrk	5:15	And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the
mrk	5:16	And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was
mrk	5:17	And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.
mrk	5:18	And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed
mrk	5:19	Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to
mrk	5:20	And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great
mrk	5:21	And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side,
mrk	5:22	And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue,
mrk	5:24	And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and
mrk	5:25	And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,
mrk	5:26	And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent
mrk	5:27	When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and
mrk	5:28	For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.
mrk	5:29	And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she
mrk	5:30	And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone
mrk	5:33	But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in
mrk	5:34	And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole;
mrk	5:35	While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue’s
mrk	5:37	And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and
mrk	5:38	And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and
mrk	5:39	And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this
mrk	5:40	And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out,
mrk	5:41	And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha
mrk	5:42	And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the
mrk	5:43	And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and
mrk	6:1	And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and
mrk	6:2	And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the
mrk	6:4	But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in
mrk	6:5	And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands
mrk	6:6	And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round
mrk	6:7	And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by
mrk	6:10	And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an
mrk	6:11	And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart
mrk	6:12	And they went out, and preached that men should repent.
mrk	6:13	And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that
mrk	6:14	And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:)
mrk	6:15	Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a
mrk	6:16	But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I
mrk	6:17	For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and
mrk	6:18	For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have
mrk	6:19	Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have
mrk	6:21	And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday
mrk	6:23	And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will
mrk	6:24	And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask?
mrk	6:25	And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked,
mrk	6:26	And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath’s sake, and
mrk	6:27	And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his
mrk	6:29	And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his
mrk	6:30	And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and
mrk	6:31	And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert
mrk	6:32	And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.
mrk	6:33	And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran
mrk	6:34	And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with
mrk	6:35	And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him,
mrk	6:37	He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say
mrk	6:39	And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the
mrk	6:40	And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.
mrk	6:41	And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he
mrk	6:42	And they did all eat, and were filled.
mrk	6:43	And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the
mrk	6:44	And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.
mrk	6:45	And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the
mrk	6:46	And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to
mrk	6:47	And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and
mrk	6:48	And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto
mrk	6:49	But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had
mrk	6:51	And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and
mrk	6:52	For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their
mrk	6:53	And when they had passed over, they came into the land of
mrk	6:54	And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew
mrk	6:56	And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or
mrk	7:1	Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the
mrk	7:2	And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled,
mrk	7:3	For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands
mrk	7:4	And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat
mrk	7:5	Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy
mrk	7:7	Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the
mrk	7:8	For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of
mrk	7:9	And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God,
mrk	7:10	For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso
mrk	7:12	And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his
mrk	7:14	And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto
mrk	7:16	If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
mrk	7:17	And when he was entered into the house from the people, his
mrk	7:18	And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do
mrk	7:21	For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts,
mrk	7:24	And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and
mrk	7:25	For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit,
mrk	7:27	But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it
mrk	7:28	And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under
mrk	7:29	And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is
mrk	7:30	And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out,
mrk	7:31	And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came
mrk	7:32	And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment
mrk	7:33	And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers
mrk	7:35	And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his
mrk	7:36	And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he
mrk	8:1	In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing
mrk	8:4	And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy
mrk	8:6	And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took
mrk	8:7	And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to
mrk	8:8	So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken
mrk	8:9	And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them
mrk	8:10	And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and
mrk	8:11	And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him,
mrk	8:12	And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this
mrk	8:13	And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to
mrk	8:14	Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they
mrk	8:15	And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of
mrk	8:16	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have
mrk	8:17	And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye,
mrk	8:20	And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of
mrk	8:21	And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand? 8:22
mrk	8:23	And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the
mrk	8:24	And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.
mrk	8:25	After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him
mrk	8:26	And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the
mrk	8:27	And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea
mrk	8:29	And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter
mrk	8:30	And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.
mrk	8:31	And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many
mrk	8:32	And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to
mrk	8:33	But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he
mrk	8:34	And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples
mrk	8:35	For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever
mrk	8:36	For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world,
mrk	9:1	And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some
mrk	9:2	And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and
mrk	9:3	And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no
mrk	9:4	And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were
mrk	9:5	And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to
mrk	9:6	For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.
mrk	9:7	And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out
mrk	9:8	And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man
mrk	9:9	And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they
mrk	9:10	And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with
mrk	9:11	And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must
mrk	9:13	But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done
mrk	9:14	And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about
mrk	9:15	And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were
mrk	9:16	And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them? 9:17 And
mrk	9:19	He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long
mrk	9:20	And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway
mrk	9:21	And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto
mrk	9:22	And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters,
mrk	9:23	Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are
mrk	9:24	And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with
mrk	9:25	When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked
mrk	9:26	And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and
mrk	9:27	But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.
mrk	9:28	And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him
mrk	9:30	And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he
mrk	9:31	For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man
mrk	9:32	But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.
mrk	9:33	And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them,
mrk	9:35	And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If
mrk	9:36	And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when
mrk	9:38	And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out
mrk	9:39	But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall
mrk	9:40	For he that is not against us is on our part.
mrk	9:41	For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name,
mrk	9:42	And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe
mrk	9:43	And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to
mrk	9:45	And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to
mrk	9:47	And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee
mrk	9:49	For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice
mrk	9:50	Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith
mrk	10:1	And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by
mrk	10:2	And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a
mrk	10:3	And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?
mrk	10:4	And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and
mrk	10:5	And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your
mrk	10:6	But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and
mrk	10:7	For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and
mrk	10:9	What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
mrk	10:10	And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same
mrk	10:11	And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and
mrk	10:12	And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to
mrk	10:13	And they brought young children to him, that he should touch
mrk	10:14	But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto
mrk	10:15	Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
mrk	10:16	And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and
mrk	10:17	And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running,
mrk	10:19	Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not
mrk	10:21	Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing
mrk	10:22	And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had
mrk	10:23	And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How
mrk	10:24	And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus
mrk	10:26	And they were astonished out of measure, saying among
mrk	10:28	Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have
mrk	10:29	And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no
mrk	10:30	But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses,
mrk	10:31	But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.
mrk	10:32	And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went
mrk	10:35	And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying,
mrk	10:36	And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?
mrk	10:37	They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy
mrk	10:38	But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink
mrk	10:41	And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with
mrk	10:42	But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that
mrk	10:43	But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great
mrk	10:45	For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
mrk	10:46	And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his
mrk	10:47	And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry
mrk	10:48	And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried
mrk	10:49	And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they
mrk	10:50	And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.
mrk	10:51	And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I
mrk	10:52	And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee
mrk	11:1	And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany,
mrk	11:3	And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord
mrk	11:4	And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door
mrk	11:5	And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye,
mrk	11:7	And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on
mrk	11:8	And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down
mrk	11:9	And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying,
mrk	11:11	And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when
mrk	11:12	And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was
mrk	11:14	And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee
mrk	11:15	And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and
mrk	11:17	And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house
mrk	11:18	And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they
mrk	11:19	And when even was come, he went out of the city.
mrk	11:20	And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree
mrk	11:21	And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold,
mrk	11:22	And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.
mrk	11:23	For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this
mrk	11:24	Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye
mrk	11:25	And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against
mrk	11:26	But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in
mrk	11:27	And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the
mrk	11:30	The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me.
mrk	11:31	And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From
mrk	11:33	And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus
mrk	12:1	And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man
mrk	12:2	And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he
mrk	12:3	And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.
mrk	12:4	And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast
mrk	12:5	And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others;
mrk	12:6	Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also
mrk	12:7	But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir;
mrk	12:8	And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the
mrk	12:9	What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come
mrk	12:10	And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the
mrk	12:13	And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the
mrk	12:14	And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that
mrk	12:16	And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image
mrk	12:17	And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things
mrk	12:18	Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no
mrk	12:20	Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and
mrk	12:21	And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and
mrk	12:22	And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman
mrk	12:23	In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife
mrk	12:24	And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err,
mrk	12:26	And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in
mrk	12:28	And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning
mrk	12:31	And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy
mrk	12:32	And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the
mrk	12:34	And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto
mrk	12:35	And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How
mrk	12:37	David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then
mrk	12:38	And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes,
mrk	12:41	And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the
mrk	12:42	And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites,
mrk	12:43	And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them,
mrk	13:1	And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto
mrk	13:2	And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great
mrk	13:3	And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple,
mrk	13:7	And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not
mrk	13:8	For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against
mrk	13:9	But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to
mrk	13:10	And the gospel must first be published among all nations.
mrk	13:11	But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no
mrk	13:12	Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the
mrk	13:13	And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that
mrk	13:14	But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of
mrk	13:16	And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take
mrk	13:17	But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck
mrk	13:19	For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the
mrk	13:20	And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh
mrk	13:21	And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or,
mrk	13:23	But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.
mrk	13:24	But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be
mrk	13:26	And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with
mrk	13:27	And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his
mrk	13:28	Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet
mrk	13:30	Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till
mrk	13:31	Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass
mrk	13:32	But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels
mrk	13:33	Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.
mrk	13:34	For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left
mrk	13:35	Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house
mrk	13:37	And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.
mrk	14:1	After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened
mrk	14:2	But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of
mrk	14:3	And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat
mrk	14:4	And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and
mrk	14:6	And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath
mrk	14:7	For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye
mrk	14:8	She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my
mrk	14:9	Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached
mrk	14:10	And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief
mrk	14:11	And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him
mrk	14:12	And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the
mrk	14:14	And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the
mrk	14:16	And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found
mrk	14:17	And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.
mrk	14:18	And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you,
mrk	14:19	And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one,
mrk	14:21	The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to
mrk	14:22	And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake
mrk	14:23	And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to
mrk	14:24	And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament,
mrk	14:25	Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the
mrk	14:26	And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of
mrk	14:27	And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of
mrk	14:28	But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.
mrk	14:29	But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet
mrk	14:30	And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day,
mrk	14:31	But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I
mrk	14:32	And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he
mrk	14:33	And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be
mrk	14:35	And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed
mrk	14:36	And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee;
mrk	14:37	And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter,
mrk	14:39	And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.
mrk	14:40	And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their
mrk	14:41	And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now,
mrk	14:42	Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.
mrk	14:43	And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the
mrk	14:44	And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying,
mrk	14:45	And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and
mrk	14:46	And they laid their hands on him, and took him.
mrk	14:47	And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant
mrk	14:48	And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as
mrk	14:50	And they all forsook him, and fled.
mrk	14:51	And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth
mrk	14:53	And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were
mrk	14:54	And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the
mrk	14:55	And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness
mrk	14:56	For many bare false witness against him, but their witness
mrk	14:57	And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him,
mrk	14:59	But neither so did their witness agree together.
mrk	14:60	And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus,
mrk	14:63	Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we
mrk	14:65	And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to
mrk	14:66	And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the
mrk	14:68	But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what
mrk	14:69	And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood
mrk	14:70	And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by
mrk	14:71	But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man
mrk	14:72	And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the
mrk	15:1	And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a
mrk	15:2	And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he
mrk	15:3	And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered
mrk	15:4	And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing?
mrk	15:5	But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.
mrk	15:6	Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever
mrk	15:7	And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that
mrk	15:8	And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he
mrk	15:9	But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you
mrk	15:11	But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather
mrk	15:12	And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then
mrk	15:14	Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And
mrk	15:15	And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas
mrk	15:16	And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium;
mrk	15:17	And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns,
mrk	15:20	And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him,
mrk	15:21	And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out
mrk	15:22	And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being
mrk	15:23	And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he
mrk	15:24	And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments,
mrk	15:25	And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.
mrk	15:26	And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE
mrk	15:27	And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right
mrk	15:28	And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was
mrk	15:29	And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and
mrk	15:31	Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves
mrk	15:32	Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that
mrk	15:33	And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the
mrk	15:34	And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
mrk	15:36	And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a
mrk	15:37	And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.
mrk	15:38	And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the
mrk	15:39	And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that
mrk	15:40	There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary
mrk	15:42	And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation,
mrk	15:44	And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto
mrk	15:45	And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to
mrk	15:46	And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in
mrk	15:47	And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he
mrk	16:1	And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the
mrk	16:2	And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they
mrk	16:3	And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone
mrk	16:5	And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on
mrk	16:6	And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of
mrk	16:7	But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth
mrk	16:8	And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they
mrk	16:9	Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he
mrk	16:10	And she went and told them that had been with him, as they
mrk	16:11	And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been
mrk	16:12	After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they
mrk	16:13	And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed
mrk	16:14	Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and
mrk	16:15	And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the
mrk	16:16	He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that
mrk	16:17	And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall
mrk	16:19	So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up
mrk	16:20	And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working
luk	1:1	Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a
luk	1:2	Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were
luk	1:5	THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain
luk	1:6	And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the
luk	1:7	And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they
luk	1:8	And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest’s office
luk	1:10	And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the
luk	1:11	And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the
luk	1:12	And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon
luk	1:13	But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer
luk	1:14	And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at
luk	1:15	For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink
luk	1:16	And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord
luk	1:17	And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to
luk	1:18	And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for
luk	1:19	And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand
luk	1:20	And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the
luk	1:21	And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he
luk	1:22	And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they
luk	1:23	And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his
luk	1:24	And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid
luk	1:26	And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a
luk	1:28	And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art
luk	1:29	And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in
luk	1:30	And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found
luk	1:31	And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a
luk	1:32	He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest:
luk	1:33	And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his
luk	1:34	Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know
luk	1:36	And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son
luk	1:37	For with God nothing shall be impossible.
luk	1:38	And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me
luk	1:39	And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with
luk	1:41	And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of
luk	1:43	And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come
luk	1:45	And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a
luk	1:46	And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, 1:47 And my spirit
luk	1:48	For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for,
luk	1:49	For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is
luk	1:50	And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to
luk	1:51	He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud
luk	1:52	He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of
luk	1:53	He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath
luk	1:54	He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;
luk	1:55	As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.
luk	1:56	And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her
luk	1:57	Now Elisabeth’s full time came that she should be delivered; and
luk	1:58	And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed
luk	1:59	And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to
luk	1:60	And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called
luk	1:61	And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is
luk	1:62	And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.
luk	1:63	And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is
luk	1:64	And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and
luk	1:65	And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these
luk	1:66	And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts,
luk	1:67	And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and
luk	1:76	And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for
luk	1:80	And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the
luk	2:1	And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree
luk	2:2	(And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of
luk	2:4	And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth,
luk	2:6	And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were
luk	2:7	And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in
luk	2:8	And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field,
luk	2:9	And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of
luk	2:10	And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you
luk	2:11	For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour,
luk	2:12	And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped
luk	2:13	And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly
luk	2:15	And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into
luk	2:16	And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the
luk	2:17	And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying
luk	2:18	And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were
luk	2:19	But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.
luk	2:20	And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all
luk	2:21	And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the
luk	2:22	And when the days of her purification according to the law of
luk	2:25	And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon;
luk	2:26	And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should
luk	2:27	And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents
luk	2:28	Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said, 2:29
luk	2:33	And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were
luk	2:34	And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold,
luk	2:36	And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of
luk	2:38	And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the
luk	2:39	And when they had performed all things according to the law of
luk	2:40	And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with
luk	2:41	Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the
luk	2:42	And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after
luk	2:43	And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child
luk	2:44	But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day’s
luk	2:45	And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem,
luk	2:46	And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the
luk	2:47	And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and
luk	2:48	And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto
luk	2:49	And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not
luk	2:51	And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject
luk	2:52	And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God
luk	3:1	Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius
luk	3:3	And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the
luk	3:5	Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be
luk	3:7	Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of
luk	3:9	And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every
luk	3:10	And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then? 3:11 He
luk	3:12	Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him,
luk	3:14	And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall
luk	3:15	And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their
luk	3:17	Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor,
luk	3:18	And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the
luk	3:19	But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his
luk	3:20	Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.
luk	3:21	Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that
luk	3:23	And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being
luk	4:1	And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and
luk	4:3	And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command
luk	4:4	And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not
luk	4:5	And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto
luk	4:6	And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and
luk	4:7	If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.
luk	4:8	And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan:
luk	4:9	And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the
luk	4:12	And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not
luk	4:13	And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from
luk	4:14	And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and
luk	4:15	And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.
luk	4:16	And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as
luk	4:17	And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias.
luk	4:20	And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and
luk	4:21	And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture
luk	4:22	And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words
luk	4:24	And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his
luk	4:25	But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days
luk	4:27	And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the
luk	4:28	And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were
luk	4:30	But he passing through the midst of them went his way, 4:31 And
luk	4:32	And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with
luk	4:33	And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an
luk	4:35	And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of
luk	4:36	And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying,
luk	4:37	And the fame of him went out into every place of the country
luk	4:38	And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon’s
luk	4:39	And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her:
luk	4:40	Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with
luk	4:41	And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou
luk	4:42	And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place:
luk	4:43	And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other
luk	4:44	And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.
luk	5:1	And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear
luk	5:3	And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon’s, and
luk	5:4	Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into
luk	5:5	And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the
luk	5:6	And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of
luk	5:7	And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other
luk	5:8	When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying,
luk	5:9	For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught
luk	5:11	And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all,
luk	5:12	And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man
luk	5:13	And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be
luk	5:14	And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to
luk	5:15	But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great
luk	5:16	And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.
luk	5:17	And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that
luk	5:18	And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a
luk	5:19	And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in
luk	5:20	And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are
luk	5:21	And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is
luk	5:22	But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto
luk	5:25	And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon
luk	5:26	And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled
luk	5:27	And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named
luk	5:28	And he left all, rose up, and followed him.
luk	5:29	And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a
luk	5:30	But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples,
luk	5:32	I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
luk	5:33	And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often,
luk	5:35	But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away
luk	5:36	And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of
luk	5:37	And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine
luk	5:38	But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are
luk	5:39	No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new: for
luk	6:1	And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he
luk	6:2	And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which
luk	6:6	And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into
luk	6:7	And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal
luk	6:8	But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the
luk	6:9	Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful
luk	6:11	And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another
luk	6:12	And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a
luk	6:13	And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of
luk	6:17	And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the
luk	6:19	And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went
luk	6:20	And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be
luk	6:21	Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed
luk	6:22	Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall
luk	6:23	Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your
luk	6:24	But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your
luk	6:25	Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you
luk	6:26	Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did
luk	6:27	But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them
luk	6:29	And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the
luk	6:30	Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh
luk	6:31	And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them
luk	6:32	For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for
luk	6:33	And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have
luk	6:34	And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank
luk	6:35	But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for
luk	6:36	Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.
luk	6:37	Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall
luk	6:39	And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind?
luk	6:41	And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but
luk	6:43	For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a
luk	6:44	For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do
luk	6:45	A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth
luk	6:46	And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I
luk	6:49	But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a
luk	7:1	Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the
luk	7:2	And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear unto him, was
luk	7:3	And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the
luk	7:4	And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying,
luk	7:6	Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the
luk	7:8	For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers,
luk	7:9	When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him
luk	7:10	And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the
luk	7:11	And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city
luk	7:12	Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was
luk	7:13	And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said
luk	7:14	And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood
luk	7:15	And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered
luk	7:16	And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying,
luk	7:17	And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and
luk	7:18	And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.
luk	7:19	And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to
luk	7:20	When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath
luk	7:22	Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John
luk	7:23	And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.
luk	7:24	And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak
luk	7:26	But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you,
luk	7:27	This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger
luk	7:28	For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is
luk	7:29	And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified
luk	7:30	But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against
luk	7:31	And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this
luk	7:33	For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine;
luk	7:34	The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a
luk	7:35	But wisdom is justified of all her children.
luk	7:36	And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him.
luk	7:37	And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she
luk	7:39	Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake
luk	7:40	And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say
luk	7:41	There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed
luk	7:42	And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both.
luk	7:44	And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this
luk	7:45	Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in
luk	7:46	My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath
luk	7:47	Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are
luk	7:48	And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.
luk	7:49	And they that sat at meat with him began to say within
luk	8:1	And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city
luk	8:4	And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him
luk	8:6	And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it
luk	8:7	And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and
luk	8:8	And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an
luk	8:9	And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?
luk	8:10	And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the
luk	8:11	Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.
luk	8:12	Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil,
luk	8:13	They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the
luk	8:14	And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have
luk	8:15	But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good
luk	8:16	No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel,
luk	8:17	For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither
luk	8:18	Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall

luk	8:20	And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy

luk	8:22	Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship
luk	8:23	But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of
luk	8:24	And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we
luk	8:25	And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid
luk	8:26	And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over
luk	8:27	And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a
luk	8:28	When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and
luk	8:29	(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man.
luk	8:31	And they besought him that he would not command them to go out
luk	8:32	And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the
luk	8:33	Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine:
luk	8:34	When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went
luk	8:35	Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and
luk	8:36	They also which saw it told them by what means he that was
luk	8:37	Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round
luk	8:38	Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him
luk	8:40	And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people
luk	8:41	And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of
luk	8:43	And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had
luk	8:44	Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and
luk	8:45	And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they
luk	8:47	And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling,
luk	8:48	And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith
luk	8:49	While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the
luk	8:50	But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not:
luk	8:51	And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in,
luk	8:52	And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not
luk	8:53	And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.
luk	8:54	And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called,
luk	8:55	And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he
luk	8:56	And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they
luk	9:1	Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power
luk	9:2	And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the
luk	9:3	And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither
luk	9:4	And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence
luk	9:5	And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city,
luk	9:6	And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the
luk	9:7	Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he
luk	9:9	And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I
luk	9:10	And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they
luk	9:11	And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he received
luk	9:12	And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and
luk	9:13	But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We
luk	9:14	For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his
luk	9:15	And they did so, and made them all sit down.
luk	9:16	Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up
luk	9:17	And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of

luk	9:19	They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and
luk	9:20	He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering
luk	9:21	And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man
luk	9:23	And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him
luk	9:24	For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever
luk	9:25	For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and
luk	9:27	But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which
luk	9:28	And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he
luk	9:29	And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and
luk	9:30	And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and
luk	9:32	But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and
luk	9:33	And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto
luk	9:34	While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them:
luk	9:35	And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my
luk	9:36	And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept
luk	9:37	And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come
luk	9:38	And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I
luk	9:39	And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it
luk	9:40	And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.
luk	9:41	And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation,
luk	9:42	And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare
luk	9:43	And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while
luk	9:45	But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them,
luk	9:46	Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be
luk	9:47	And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child,
luk	9:49	And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils
luk	9:50	And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not
luk	9:51	And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be
luk	9:53	And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he
luk	9:54	And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord,
luk	9:56	For the Son of man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to
luk	9:57	And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man
luk	9:58	And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air
luk	9:59	And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me
luk	9:60	Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou
luk	9:61	And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first
luk	9:62	And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the
luk	10:1	After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and
luk	10:2	Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the
luk	10:3	Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.
luk	10:4	Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by
luk	10:5	And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this
luk	10:6	And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it:
luk	10:7	And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as
luk	10:8	And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such
luk	10:10	But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go
luk	10:12	But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day
luk	10:13	Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the
luk	10:14	But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the
luk	10:15	And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be
luk	10:16	He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you
luk	10:17	And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the
luk	10:18	And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from
luk	10:19	Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and
luk	10:20	Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are
luk	10:21	In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O
luk	10:22	All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth
luk	10:23	And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately,
luk	10:25	And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying,
luk	10:28	And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and
luk	10:29	But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is
luk	10:31	And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and
luk	10:32	And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked
luk	10:33	But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and
luk	10:35	And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and
luk	10:36	Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him
luk	10:38	Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a
luk	10:39	And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus’ feet,
luk	10:40	But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and
luk	10:41	And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art
luk	11:1	And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place,
luk	11:2	And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in
luk	11:3	Give us day by day our daily bread.
luk	11:4	And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is
luk	11:5	And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and
luk	11:8	I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he
luk	11:9	And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye
luk	11:10	For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh
luk	11:11	If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he
luk	11:15	But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub
luk	11:16	And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.
luk	11:17	But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom
luk	11:18	If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom
luk	11:19	And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast
luk	11:20	But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the
luk	11:21	When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in
luk	11:23	He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not
luk	11:24	When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through
luk	11:25	And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.
luk	11:26	Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked
luk	11:27	And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman
luk	11:28	But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of
luk	11:29	And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to
luk	11:30	For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the
luk	11:31	The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the
luk	11:32	The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this
luk	11:33	No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret
luk	11:34	The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is
luk	11:35	Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not
luk	11:36	If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part
luk	11:37	And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with
luk	11:38	And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first
luk	11:39	And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the
luk	11:40	Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that
luk	11:42	But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all
luk	11:43	Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the
luk	11:44	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as
luk	11:45	Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master,
luk	11:46	And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with
luk	11:47	Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and
luk	11:48	Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers:
luk	11:49	Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets
luk	11:52	Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of
luk	11:53	And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the
luk	12:1	In the mean time, when there were gathered together an
luk	12:2	For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither
luk	12:3	Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in
luk	12:4	And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill
luk	12:5	But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after
luk	12:6	Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them
luk	12:8	Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him
luk	12:10	And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it
luk	12:11	And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto
luk	12:13	And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my
luk	12:14	And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over
luk	12:16	And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a
luk	12:19	And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up
luk	12:20	But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be
luk	12:22	And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take
luk	12:23	The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.
luk	12:24	Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which
luk	12:28	If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field,
luk	12:30	For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and
luk	12:31	But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things
luk	12:32	Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to
luk	12:33	Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which
luk	12:34	For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
luk	12:35	Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; 12:36
luk	12:37	Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall
luk	12:38	And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third
luk	12:39	And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what
luk	12:40	Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour
luk	12:41	Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto
luk	12:44	Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all
luk	12:45	But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his
luk	12:47	And that servant, which knew his lord’s will, and prepared not
luk	12:48	But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes,
luk	12:49	I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be
luk	12:52	For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided,
luk	12:53	The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against
luk	12:54	And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of
luk	12:55	And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, There will be heat;
luk	12:56	Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the
luk	12:59	I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid
luk	13:1	There were present at that season some that told him of the
luk	13:2	And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these
luk	13:4	Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew
luk	13:6	He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted
luk	13:7	Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these
luk	13:10	And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.
luk	13:11	And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity
luk	13:12	And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her,
luk	13:13	And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made
luk	13:14	And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation,
luk	13:15	The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not
luk	13:18	Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and
luk	13:20	And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?
luk	13:21	It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures
luk	13:22	And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and
luk	13:23	Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And
luk	13:25	When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to
luk	13:27	But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are;
luk	13:28	There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see
luk	13:29	And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from
luk	13:30	And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are
luk	13:31	The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto
luk	13:32	And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast
luk	13:33	Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day
luk	13:34	O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest
luk	14:1	And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the
luk	14:2	And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the
luk	14:3	And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying,
luk	14:6	And they could not answer him again to these things.
luk	14:7	And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he
luk	14:8	When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the
luk	14:9	And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man
luk	14:10	But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room;
luk	14:11	For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that
luk	14:12	Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a
luk	14:13	But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the
luk	14:15	And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these
luk	14:16	Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and
luk	14:18	And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first
luk	14:19	And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to
luk	14:20	And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot
luk	14:21	So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the
luk	14:22	And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded,
luk	14:23	And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and
luk	14:24	For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden
luk	14:25	And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and
luk	14:27	And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot
luk	14:28	For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down
luk	14:29	Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able
luk	14:31	Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth
luk	14:33	So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that
luk	14:34	Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith
luk	15:1	Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear
luk	15:2	And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man
luk	15:3	And he spake this parable unto them, saying, 15:4 What man of
luk	15:6	And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and
luk	15:7	I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one
luk	15:8	Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one
luk	15:10	Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the
luk	15:11	And he said, A certain man had two sons: 15:12 And the younger
luk	15:13	And not many days after the younger son gathered all together,
luk	15:14	And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that
luk	15:15	And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and
luk	15:16	And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the
luk	15:17	And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of
luk	15:18	I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father,
luk	15:20	And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a
luk	15:21	And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven,
luk	15:22	But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe,
luk	15:23	And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat,
luk	15:25	Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh
luk	15:26	And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things
luk	15:27	And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath
luk	15:28	And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father
luk	15:29	And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I
luk	15:31	And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I
luk	15:32	It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy
luk	16:1	And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich
luk	16:2	And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this
luk	16:3	Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my
luk	16:4	I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the
luk	16:5	So he called every one of his lord’s debtors unto him, and said
luk	16:7	Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An
luk	16:8	And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done
luk	16:9	And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of
luk	16:10	He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in
luk	16:11	If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous
luk	16:14	And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these
luk	16:15	And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves
luk	16:16	The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the
luk	16:17	And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle
luk	16:18	Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another,
luk	16:19	There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and
luk	16:22	And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by
luk	16:24	And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and
luk	16:25	But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime
luk	16:26	And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf
luk	16:27	Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest
luk	16:29	Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let
luk	16:30	And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from
luk	16:31	And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets,
luk	17:1	Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that
luk	17:3	Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee,
luk	17:4	And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven
luk	17:5	And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.
luk	17:6	And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye
luk	17:7	But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle,
luk	17:10	So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which
luk	17:11	And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed
luk	17:12	And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men
luk	17:14	And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto
luk	17:15	And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back,
luk	17:17	And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where
luk	17:19	And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made

luk	17:24	For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under
luk	17:25	But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this
luk	17:26	And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the
luk	17:27	They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in
luk	17:28	Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they
luk	17:30	Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is
luk	17:31	In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff
luk	17:32	Remember Lot’s wife.
luk	17:33	Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and
luk	17:34	I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the
luk	17:35	Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken,
luk	17:36	Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the
luk	17:37	And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said
luk	18:1	And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought
luk	18:4	And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within
luk	18:6	And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.
luk	18:7	And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night
luk	18:11	The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank
luk	18:12	I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.
luk	18:13	And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much
luk	18:14	I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather
luk	18:15	And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch
luk	18:16	But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children
luk	18:17	Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
luk	18:18	And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I
luk	18:20	Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not
luk	18:21	And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.
luk	18:22	Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest
luk	18:23	And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very
luk	18:24	And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How
luk	18:25	For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than
luk	18:26	And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved? 18:27 And
luk	18:28	Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.
luk	18:29	And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man
luk	18:31	Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we
luk	18:32	For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be
luk	18:34	And they understood none of these things: and this saying was
luk	18:35	And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a
luk	18:37	And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.
luk	18:38	And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on
luk	18:39	And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his
luk	18:40	And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and
luk	18:42	And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved
luk	18:43	And immediately he received his sight, and followed him,
luk	19:1	And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.
luk	19:2	And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief
luk	19:3	And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the
luk	19:4	And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see
luk	19:5	And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and
luk	19:6	And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.
luk	19:7	And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone
luk	19:8	And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord: Behold, Lord, the
luk	19:9	And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this
luk	19:10	For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was
luk	19:11	And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable,
luk	19:12	He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to
luk	19:13	And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds,
luk	19:14	But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him,
luk	19:15	And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received
luk	19:16	Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten
luk	19:17	And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast
luk	19:18	And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five
luk	19:19	And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.
luk	19:20	And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which
luk	19:22	And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee,
luk	19:25	(And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.) 19:26 For I
luk	19:27	But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over
luk	19:28	And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to
luk	19:29	And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and
luk	19:31	And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say
luk	19:32	And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had
luk	19:33	And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto
luk	19:35	And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon
luk	19:36	And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.
luk	19:37	And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount
luk	19:39	And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto
luk	19:40	And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these
luk	19:41	And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,
luk	19:42	Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy
luk	19:43	For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast
luk	19:45	And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that
luk	19:47	And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the
luk	20:1	And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the
luk	20:7	And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.
luk	20:8	And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I
luk	20:9	Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man
luk	20:10	And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they
luk	20:11	And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and
luk	20:12	And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast
luk	20:13	Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send
luk	20:14	But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves,
luk	20:15	So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What
luk	20:17	And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written,
luk	20:19	And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to
luk	20:20	And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign
luk	20:21	And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and
luk	20:25	And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things
luk	20:26	And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and
luk	20:27	Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there
luk	20:29	There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife,
luk	20:30	And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.
luk	20:31	And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and
luk	20:32	Last of all the woman died also.
luk	20:33	Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for
luk	20:34	And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world
luk	20:37	Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush,
luk	20:38	For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live
luk	20:39	Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast
luk	20:40	And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.
luk	20:41	And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David’s son?
luk	20:42	And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said
luk	20:44	David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son? 20:45
luk	20:46	Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and
luk	21:1	And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into
luk	21:2	And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two
luk	21:3	And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath
luk	21:5	And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly
luk	21:7	And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things
luk	21:8	And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall
luk	21:9	But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified:
luk	21:10	Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and
luk	21:12	But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and
luk	21:13	And it shall turn to you for a testimony.
luk	21:14	Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what
luk	21:16	And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and
luk	21:17	And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake.
luk	21:18	But there shall not an hair of your head perish.
luk	21:19	In your patience possess ye your souls.
luk	21:20	And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know
luk	21:21	Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let
luk	21:22	For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are
luk	21:23	But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give
luk	21:24	And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led
luk	21:25	And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the
luk	21:27	And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with
luk	21:28	And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and
luk	21:29	And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the
luk	21:31	So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye
luk	21:32	Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till
luk	21:33	Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass
luk	21:34	And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be
luk	21:35	For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face
luk	21:36	Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted
luk	21:37	And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night
luk	21:38	And all the people came early in the morning to him in the
luk	22:1	Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the
luk	22:2	And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him;
luk	22:3	Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the
luk	22:4	And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and
luk	22:5	And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.
luk	22:6	And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them
luk	22:7	Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be
luk	22:8	And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the
luk	22:9	And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare? 22:10
luk	22:11	And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith
luk	22:13	And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made
luk	22:14	And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles
luk	22:15	And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this
luk	22:17	And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and
luk	22:19	And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto
luk	22:20	Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new
luk	22:21	But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the
luk	22:22	And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe
luk	22:24	And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be
luk	22:25	And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise
luk	22:26	But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let
luk	22:27	For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that
luk	22:28	Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.
luk	22:29	And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed
luk	22:31	And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to
luk	22:33	And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both
luk	22:34	And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this
luk	22:35	And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip,
luk	22:36	Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him
luk	22:37	For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be
luk	22:38	And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said
luk	22:39	And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of
luk	22:40	And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye
luk	22:41	And he was withdrawn from them about a stone’s cast, and kneeled
luk	22:43	And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening
luk	22:44	And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat
luk	22:45	And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples,
luk	22:47	And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was
luk	22:48	But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man
luk	22:50	And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut
luk	22:51	And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched
luk	22:52	Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the
luk	22:54	Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high
luk	22:55	And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and
luk	22:56	But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and
luk	22:57	And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.
luk	22:58	And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art
luk	22:59	And about the space of one hour after another confidently
luk	22:60	And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And
luk	22:61	And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered
luk	22:62	And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.
luk	22:63	And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.
luk	22:64	And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face,
luk	22:66	And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the
luk	22:69	Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the
luk	22:70	Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said
luk	22:71	And they said, What need we any further witness? for we
luk	23:1	And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.
luk	23:2	And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow
luk	23:3	And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And
luk	23:4	Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find
luk	23:5	And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people,
luk	23:6	When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a
luk	23:7	And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod’s
luk	23:8	And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was
luk	23:9	Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him
luk	23:10	And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused
luk	23:11	And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him,
luk	23:12	And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together:
luk	23:13	And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and
luk	23:16	I will therefore chastise him, and release him.
luk	23:17	(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)
luk	23:18	And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and
luk	23:21	But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.
luk	23:22	And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he
luk	23:23	And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might
luk	23:24	And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.
luk	23:25	And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was
luk	23:26	And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a
luk	23:27	And there followed him a great company of people, and of women,
luk	23:28	But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep
luk	23:29	For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say,
luk	23:30	Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and
luk	23:31	For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done
luk	23:33	And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary,
luk	23:34	Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what
luk	23:35	And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them
luk	23:36	And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering
luk	23:38	And a superscription also was written over him in letters of
luk	23:39	And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him,
luk	23:40	But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear
luk	23:42	And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into
luk	23:43	And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt
luk	23:44	And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over
luk	23:45	And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in
luk	23:46	And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father,
luk	23:47	Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God,
luk	23:48	And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding
luk	23:49	And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from
luk	23:50	And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he
luk	23:52	This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
luk	23:53	And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a
luk	23:54	And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.
luk	23:55	And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed
luk	23:56	And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested
luk	24:1	Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning,
luk	24:2	And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.
luk	24:3	And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
luk	24:4	And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout,
luk	24:7	Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful
luk	24:8	And they remembered his words, 24:9 And returned from the
luk	24:10	It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James,
luk	24:11	And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed
luk	24:12	Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down,
luk	24:13	And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called
luk	24:14	And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
luk	24:15	And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and
luk	24:16	But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.
luk	24:17	And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these
luk	24:20	And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be
luk	24:21	But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed
luk	24:22	Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished,
luk	24:24	And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre,
luk	24:25	Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe
luk	24:28	And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he
luk	24:29	But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is
luk	24:30	And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread,
luk	24:31	And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished
luk	24:32	And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us,
luk	24:35	And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was
luk	24:36	And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of
luk	24:37	But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they
luk	24:38	And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts
luk	24:40	And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his
luk	24:41	And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said
luk	24:43	And he took it, and did eat before them.
luk	24:44	And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto
luk	24:45	Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand
luk	24:47	And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in
luk	24:48	And ye are witnesses of these things.
luk	24:49	And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry
luk	24:50	And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his
luk	24:51	And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from
luk	24:52	And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great
jhn	1:1	In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
jhn	1:2	The same was in the beginning with God.
jhn	1:3	All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing
jhn	1:4	In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
jhn	1:5	And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended
jhn	1:6	There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
jhn	1:7	The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that
jhn	1:8	He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.
jhn	1:9	That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into
jhn	1:10	He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world
jhn	1:11	He came unto his own, and his own received him not.
jhn	1:12	But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the
jhn	1:14	And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld
jhn	1:15	John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom
jhn	1:16	And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.
jhn	1:17	For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus
jhn	1:18	No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is
jhn	1:19	And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and
jhn	1:21	And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am
jhn	1:22	Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer
jhn	1:24	And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.
jhn	1:25	And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then,
jhn	1:28	These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was
jhn	1:29	The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold
jhn	1:30	This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is
jhn	1:31	And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to
jhn	1:32	And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from
jhn	1:33	And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water,
jhn	1:34	And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.
jhn	1:35	Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;
jhn	1:36	And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of
jhn	1:38	Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them,
jhn	1:40	One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was
jhn	1:41	He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We
jhn	1:42	And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said,
jhn	1:43	The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth
jhn	1:44	Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
jhn	1:45	Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him,
jhn	1:46	And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of
jhn	1:47	Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an
jhn	1:49	Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of
jhn	1:50	Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw
jhn	1:51	And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter
jhn	2:1	And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the
jhn	2:3	And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him,
jhn	2:4	Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine
jhn	2:5	His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you,
jhn	2:6	And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner
jhn	2:7	Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they

jhn	2:9	When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made
jhn	2:11	This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and
jhn	2:12	After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his
jhn	2:13	And the Jews’ passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to
jhn	2:14	And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves,
jhn	2:17	And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of
jhn	2:18	Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou
jhn	2:20	Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in
jhn	2:22	When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples
jhn	2:23	Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day,
jhn	2:24	But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all
jhn	3:1	There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the
jhn	3:3	Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
jhn	3:4	Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old?
jhn	3:6	That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born
jhn	3:7	Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.
jhn	3:8	The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound
jhn	3:9	Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?
jhn	3:10	Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel,
jhn	3:12	If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall
jhn	3:14	And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so
jhn	3:16	For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
jhn	3:17	For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but
jhn	3:18	He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth
jhn	3:19	And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world,
jhn	3:20	For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to
jhn	3:21	But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may
jhn	3:22	After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of
jhn	3:23	And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there
jhn	3:24	For John was not yet cast into prison.
jhn	3:25	Then there arose a question between some of John’s disciples and
jhn	3:26	And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was
jhn	3:27	John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be
jhn	3:28	Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ,
jhn	3:29	He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the
jhn	3:30	He must increase, but I must decrease.
jhn	3:31	He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth
jhn	3:32	And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man
jhn	3:33	He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God
jhn	3:34	For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God
jhn	3:35	The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his
jhn	3:36	He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that
jhn	4:1	When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that
jhn	4:4	And he must needs go through Samaria.
jhn	4:5	Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near
jhn	4:6	Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with
jhn	4:7	There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto
jhn	4:8	(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.) 4:9
jhn	4:10	Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of
jhn	4:11	The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with,
jhn	4:12	Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well,
jhn	4:15	The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst
jhn	4:16	Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
jhn	4:17	The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto
jhn	4:19	The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a
jhn	4:20	Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in
jhn	4:21	Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye
jhn	4:22	Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for
jhn	4:23	But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall
jhn	4:24	God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in
jhn	4:25	The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is
jhn	4:26	Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.
jhn	4:27	And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked
jhn	4:31	In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.
jhn	4:32	But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.
jhn	4:33	Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought
jhn	4:35	Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest?
jhn	4:36	And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto
jhn	4:37	And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.
jhn	4:38	I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men
jhn	4:39	And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the
jhn	4:40	So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that
jhn	4:41	And many more believed because of his own word; 4:42 And said
jhn	4:43	Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.
jhn	4:44	For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his
jhn	4:45	Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him,
jhn	4:46	So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water
jhn	4:47	When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he
jhn	4:48	Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye
jhn	4:49	The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.
jhn	4:50	Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man
jhn	4:51	And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him,
jhn	4:52	Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And
jhn	4:53	So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which
jhn	4:54	This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come
jhn	5:1	After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to
jhn	5:2	Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is
jhn	5:3	In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt,
jhn	5:4	For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and
jhn	5:5	And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and
jhn	5:6	When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time
jhn	5:8	Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.
jhn	5:9	And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and
jhn	5:10	The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the
jhn	5:11	He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me,
jhn	5:12	Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take
jhn	5:14	Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him,
jhn	5:15	The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had
jhn	5:16	And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay
jhn	5:17	But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.
jhn	5:18	Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not
jhn	5:19	Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say
jhn	5:20	For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that
jhn	5:21	For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even
jhn	5:22	For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment
jhn	5:24	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and
jhn	5:25	Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is,
jhn	5:26	For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the
jhn	5:28	Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that
jhn	5:30	I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my
jhn	5:31	If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.
jhn	5:32	There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the
jhn	5:33	Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.
jhn	5:34	But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say,
jhn	5:35	He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a
jhn	5:36	But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which
jhn	5:37	And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of
jhn	5:38	And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent,
jhn	5:39	Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life:
jhn	5:40	And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.
jhn	5:41	I receive not honour from men.
jhn	5:42	But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.
jhn	5:43	I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another
jhn	5:44	How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek
jhn	5:46	For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he
jhn	5:47	But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my
jhn	6:2	And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles
jhn	6:3	And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his
jhn	6:4	And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.
jhn	6:5	When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come
jhn	6:7	Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not
jhn	6:8	One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, saith unto
jhn	6:11	And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he
jhn	6:12	When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the
jhn	6:13	Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets
jhn	6:14	Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did,
jhn	6:15	When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him
jhn	6:16	And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,
jhn	6:17	And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum.
jhn	6:18	And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.
jhn	6:19	So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs,
jhn	6:20	But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.
jhn	6:21	Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately
jhn	6:22	The day following, when the people which stood on the other side
jhn	6:23	(Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place
jhn	6:25	And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they
jhn	6:27	Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which
jhn	6:28	Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the
jhn	6:30	They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that
jhn	6:32	Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses
jhn	6:33	For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and
jhn	6:34	Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.
jhn	6:35	And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh
jhn	6:36	But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.
jhn	6:37	All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that
jhn	6:38	For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the
jhn	6:39	And this is the Father’s will which hath sent me, that of all
jhn	6:40	And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which
jhn	6:41	The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread
jhn	6:42	And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father
jhn	6:44	No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw
jhn	6:45	It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of
jhn	6:46	Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God,
jhn	6:47	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath
jhn	6:48	I am that bread of life.
jhn	6:49	Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.
jhn	6:50	This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may
jhn	6:51	I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat
jhn	6:52	The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this
jhn	6:54	Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life;
jhn	6:55	For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
jhn	6:56	He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me,
jhn	6:57	As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so
jhn	6:58	This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your
jhn	6:59	These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
jhn	6:60	Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said,
jhn	6:64	But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from
jhn	6:65	And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto
jhn	6:66	From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no
jhn	6:67	Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away? 6:68 Then
jhn	6:69	And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of
jhn	6:70	Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you
jhn	7:1	After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk
jhn	7:2	Now the Jew’s feast of tabernacles was at hand.
jhn	7:3	His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into
jhn	7:4	For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself
jhn	7:5	For neither did his brethren believe in him.
jhn	7:6	Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time
jhn	7:7	The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of
jhn	7:8	Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my
jhn	7:9	When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.
jhn	7:10	But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the
jhn	7:11	Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?
jhn	7:12	And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for
jhn	7:13	Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.
jhn	7:14	Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple,
jhn	7:15	And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters,
jhn	7:17	If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine,
jhn	7:18	He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that
jhn	7:19	Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the
jhn	7:22	Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of
jhn	7:23	If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of
jhn	7:25	Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they
jhn	7:27	Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no
jhn	7:28	Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know
jhn	7:29	But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.
jhn	7:30	Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him,
jhn	7:31	And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ
jhn	7:32	The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things
jhn	7:33	Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and
jhn	7:34	Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither
jhn	7:35	Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we
jhn	7:38	He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his
jhn	7:39	(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him
jhn	7:41	Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come
jhn	7:44	And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on
jhn	7:45	Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and
jhn	7:47	Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived? 7:48
jhn	7:50	Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being
jhn	7:53	And every man went unto his own house.
jhn	8:1	Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.
jhn	8:2	And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all
jhn	8:3	And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in
jhn	8:5	Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but
jhn	8:7	So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said
jhn	8:8	And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.
jhn	8:9	And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience,
jhn	8:10	When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he
jhn	8:12	Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the
jhn	8:13	The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of
jhn	8:14	Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of
jhn	8:15	Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.
jhn	8:16	And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but
jhn	8:17	It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is
jhn	8:18	I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me
jhn	8:19	Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye
jhn	8:20	These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the
jhn	8:21	Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek
jhn	8:22	Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith,
jhn	8:23	And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye
jhn	8:24	I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if
jhn	8:25	Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them,
jhn	8:26	I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent
jhn	8:27	They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.
jhn	8:28	Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man,
jhn	8:29	And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me
jhn	8:30	As he spake these words, many believed on him.
jhn	8:31	Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye
jhn	8:33	They answered him, We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in
jhn	8:35	And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son
jhn	8:36	If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free
jhn	8:37	I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me,
jhn	8:38	I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that
jhn	8:39	They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus
jhn	8:40	But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth,
jhn	8:41	Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not
jhn	8:42	Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me:
jhn	8:43	Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear
jhn	8:44	Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye
jhn	8:45	And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.
jhn	8:46	Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do
jhn	8:48	Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that
jhn	8:50	And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and
jhn	8:51	Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall
jhn	8:52	Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil.
jhn	8:53	Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the
jhn	8:56	Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and
jhn	8:57	Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old,
jhn	8:59	Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself,
jhn	9:1	And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his
jhn	9:2	And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this
jhn	9:4	I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the
jhn	9:5	As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
jhn	9:6	When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of
jhn	9:7	And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by
jhn	9:8	The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that
jhn	9:10	Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened? 9:11
jhn	9:12	Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.
jhn	9:13	They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.
jhn	9:14	And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened
jhn	9:15	Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his
jhn	9:16	Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God,
jhn	9:17	They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that
jhn	9:18	But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been
jhn	9:19	And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was
jhn	9:21	But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened
jhn	9:22	These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for
jhn	9:23	Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.
jhn	9:24	Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him,
jhn	9:25	He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not:
jhn	9:26	Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he
jhn	9:29	We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know
jhn	9:30	The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous
jhn	9:31	Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a
jhn	9:32	Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the
jhn	9:33	If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.
jhn	9:34	They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in
jhn	9:35	Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found
jhn	9:38	And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.
jhn	9:39	And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they
jhn	9:40	And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words,
jhn	10:1	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door
jhn	10:2	But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
jhn	10:3	To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he
jhn	10:4	And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them,
jhn	10:5	And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for
jhn	10:6	This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what
jhn	10:7	Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
jhn	10:8	All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the
jhn	10:9	I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and
jhn	10:10	The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to
jhn	10:11	I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for
jhn	10:12	But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the
jhn	10:13	The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not
jhn	10:14	I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.
jhn	10:15	As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay
jhn	10:16	And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I
jhn	10:17	Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life,
jhn	10:18	No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have
jhn	10:19	There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these
jhn	10:20	And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye
jhn	10:23	And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon’s porch.
jhn	10:24	Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long
jhn	10:25	Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works
jhn	10:26	But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said
jhn	10:27	My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
jhn	10:28	And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish,
jhn	10:29	My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man
jhn	10:30	I and my Father are one.
jhn	10:31	Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.
jhn	10:32	Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my
jhn	10:34	Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye
jhn	10:38	But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that
jhn	10:39	Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of
jhn	10:41	And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but
jhn	10:42	And many believed on him there.
jhn	11:1	Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town
jhn	11:2	(It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and
jhn	11:4	When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death,
jhn	11:5	Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
jhn	11:6	When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days
jhn	11:7	Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea
jhn	11:8	His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to
jhn	11:10	But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is
jhn	11:11	These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our
jhn	11:12	Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.
jhn	11:13	Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had
jhn	11:14	Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.
jhn	11:15	And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent
jhn	11:16	Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellow
jhn	11:17	Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave
jhn	11:18	Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:
jhn	11:19	And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them
jhn	11:20	Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went
jhn	11:21	Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my
jhn	11:22	But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God
jhn	11:23	Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.
jhn	11:24	Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the
jhn	11:25	Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he
jhn	11:28	And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her
jhn	11:29	As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.
jhn	11:30	Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place
jhn	11:31	The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted
jhn	11:32	Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell
jhn	11:33	When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping
jhn	11:34	And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come
jhn	11:35	Jesus wept.
jhn	11:36	Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him! 11:37 And some of
jhn	11:39	Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him
jhn	11:40	Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou
jhn	11:42	And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the
jhn	11:43	And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice,
jhn	11:44	And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with
jhn	11:45	Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the
jhn	11:46	But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them
jhn	11:47	Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and
jhn	11:48	If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the
jhn	11:49	And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same
jhn	11:51	And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that
jhn	11:53	Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put
jhn	11:54	Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went
jhn	11:55	And the Jews’ passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of
jhn	11:56	Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they
jhn	12:1	Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where
jhn	12:2	There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was
jhn	12:3	Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and
jhn	12:4	Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son,
jhn	12:7	Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying
jhn	12:8	For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.
jhn	12:9	Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and
jhn	12:10	But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also
jhn	12:12	On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when
jhn	12:14	And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is
jhn	12:16	These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when
jhn	12:17	The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus
jhn	12:18	For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that
jhn	12:19	The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how
jhn	12:20	And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship
jhn	12:22	Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip
jhn	12:23	And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son
jhn	12:24	Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into
jhn	12:25	He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his
jhn	12:26	If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there
jhn	12:27	Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me
jhn	12:28	Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven,
jhn	12:29	The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it
jhn	12:30	Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but
jhn	12:31	Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this
jhn	12:32	And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto
jhn	12:33	This he said, signifying what death he should die.
jhn	12:34	The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that
jhn	12:36	While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the
jhn	12:37	But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they
jhn	12:41	These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of
jhn	12:42	Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him;
jhn	12:44	Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on
jhn	12:45	And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.
jhn	12:46	I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me
jhn	12:47	And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not:
jhn	12:48	He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that
jhn	12:49	For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me,
jhn	12:50	And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever
jhn	13:1	Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his
jhn	13:2	And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart
jhn	13:5	After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the
jhn	13:6	Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord,
jhn	13:8	Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus
jhn	13:9	Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my
jhn	13:10	Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash
jhn	13:11	For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not
jhn	13:12	So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments,
jhn	13:14	If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also
jhn	13:15	For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have
jhn	13:16	Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than
jhn	13:17	If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.
jhn	13:18	I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the
jhn	13:19	Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye
jhn	13:20	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I
jhn	13:21	When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and
jhn	13:22	Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he
jhn	13:23	Now there was leaning on Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, whom
jhn	13:24	Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it
jhn	13:25	He then lying on Jesus’ breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?
jhn	13:26	Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I
jhn	13:27	And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto
jhn	13:28	Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto
jhn	13:29	For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus
jhn	13:30	He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was
jhn	13:31	Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of
jhn	13:32	If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in
jhn	13:33	Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek
jhn	13:34	A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as
jhn	13:35	By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have
jhn	13:36	Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus
jhn	13:37	Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will
jhn	13:38	Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake?
jhn	14:1	Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also
jhn	14:2	In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I
jhn	14:3	And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and
jhn	14:4	And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.
jhn	14:5	Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and
jhn	14:7	If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from
jhn	14:8	Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth
jhn	14:9	Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet
jhn	14:11	Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or
jhn	14:12	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the
jhn	14:13	And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the
jhn	14:14	If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.
jhn	14:15	If ye love me, keep my commandments.
jhn	14:16	And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another
jhn	14:18	I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.
jhn	14:19	Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see
jhn	14:20	At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me,
jhn	14:21	He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that
jhn	14:22	Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou
jhn	14:24	He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which
jhn	14:25	These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.
jhn	14:26	But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will
jhn	14:27	Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the
jhn	14:28	Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again
jhn	14:29	And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is
jhn	14:30	Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this
jhn	14:31	But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the
jhn	15:1	I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.
jhn	15:2	Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and
jhn	15:3	Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.
jhn	15:4	Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of
jhn	15:5	I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I
jhn	15:6	If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is
jhn	15:7	If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what
jhn	15:8	Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall
jhn	15:9	As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in
jhn	15:10	If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I
jhn	15:11	These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in
jhn	15:12	This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have
jhn	15:13	Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life
jhn	15:14	Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.
jhn	15:15	Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not
jhn	15:16	Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you,
jhn	15:17	These things I command you, that ye love one another.
jhn	15:18	If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated
jhn	15:19	If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but
jhn	15:20	Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not
jhn	15:21	But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake,
jhn	15:22	If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin:
jhn	15:23	He that hateth me hateth my Father also.
jhn	15:24	If I had not done among them the works which none other man did,
jhn	15:25	But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that
jhn	15:26	But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from
jhn	16:1	These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be
jhn	16:2	They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh,
jhn	16:3	And these things will they do unto you, because they have not
jhn	16:4	But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come,
jhn	16:5	But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh
jhn	16:7	Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I
jhn	16:8	And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of
jhn	16:12	I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them
jhn	16:13	Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you
jhn	16:14	He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall
jhn	16:15	All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that
jhn	16:16	A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little
jhn	16:17	Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this
jhn	16:19	Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto
jhn	16:21	A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is
jhn	16:22	And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and
jhn	16:23	And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say
jhn	16:24	Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall
jhn	16:25	These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time
jhn	16:26	At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you,
jhn	16:28	I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again,
jhn	16:29	His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and
jhn	16:30	Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not
jhn	16:31	Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe? 16:32 Behold, the hour
jhn	16:33	These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have
jhn	17:1	These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and
jhn	17:3	And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true
jhn	17:4	I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work
jhn	17:5	And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the
jhn	17:6	I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out
jhn	17:7	Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me
jhn	17:8	For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and
jhn	17:9	I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which
jhn	17:10	And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified
jhn	17:11	And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world,
jhn	17:12	While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name:
jhn	17:13	And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world,
jhn	17:14	I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them,
jhn	17:15	I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but
jhn	17:16	They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
jhn	17:17	Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.
jhn	17:18	As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent
jhn	17:19	And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be
jhn	17:20	Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall
jhn	17:22	And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they
jhn	17:24	Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with
jhn	17:25	O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have
jhn	17:26	And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it:
jhn	18:1	When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his
jhn	18:2	And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus
jhn	18:3	Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the
jhn	18:4	Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him,
jhn	18:6	As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went
jhn	18:7	Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of
jhn	18:8	Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye
jhn	18:10	Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high
jhn	18:11	Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath:
jhn	18:14	Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was
jhn	18:15	And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple:
jhn	18:16	But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other
jhn	18:17	Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not
jhn	18:18	And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire
jhn	18:19	The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his
jhn	18:20	Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught
jhn	18:21	Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said
jhn	18:22	And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by
jhn	18:25	And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore
jhn	18:26	One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose
jhn	18:27	Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.
jhn	18:28	Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and
jhn	18:29	Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring
jhn	18:31	Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according
jhn	18:33	Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called
jhn	18:36	Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom
jhn	18:37	Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus
jhn	18:38	Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this,
jhn	18:39	But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the
jhn	19:1	Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.
jhn	19:2	And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his
jhn	19:4	Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I
jhn	19:5	Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the
jhn	19:7	The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to
jhn	19:8	When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;
jhn	19:9	And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus,
jhn	19:10	Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest
jhn	19:12	And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews
jhn	19:13	When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth,
jhn	19:14	And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth
jhn	19:16	Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And
jhn	19:17	And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the
jhn	19:19	And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the
jhn	19:20	This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus
jhn	19:21	Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not,
jhn	19:22	Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.
jhn	19:23	Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his
jhn	19:24	They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but
jhn	19:25	Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his
jhn	19:26	When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing
jhn	19:27	Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that
jhn	19:28	After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished,
jhn	19:29	Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a
jhn	19:30	When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is
jhn	19:31	The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the
jhn	19:32	Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of
jhn	19:33	But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already,
jhn	19:35	And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he
jhn	19:36	For these things were done, that the scripture should be
jhn	19:37	And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom
jhn	19:38	And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus,
jhn	19:39	And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus
jhn	19:40	Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes
jhn	19:41	Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and
jhn	19:42	There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews’ preparation
jhn	20:1	The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it
jhn	20:2	Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other
jhn	20:3	Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to
jhn	20:4	So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun
jhn	20:5	And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes
jhn	20:6	Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the
jhn	20:8	Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the
jhn	20:9	For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again
jhn	20:10	Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.
jhn	20:11	But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she
jhn	20:13	And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto
jhn	20:14	And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw
jhn	20:15	Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest
jhn	20:16	Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto
jhn	20:17	Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to
jhn	20:18	Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the
jhn	20:19	Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week,
jhn	20:20	And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his
jhn	20:21	Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father
jhn	20:22	And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto
jhn	20:24	But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them
jhn	20:25	The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the
jhn	20:26	And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas
jhn	20:27	Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my
jhn	20:28	And Thomas answered and said unto him, My LORD and my God.
jhn	20:29	Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou
jhn	20:30	And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his
jhn	21:1	After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at
jhn	21:2	There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and
jhn	21:3	Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him,
jhn	21:4	But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but
jhn	21:5	Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They
jhn	21:6	And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the
jhn	21:7	Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is
jhn	21:8	And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not
jhn	21:9	As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals
jhn	21:10	Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now
jhn	21:11	Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great
jhn	21:12	Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples
jhn	21:13	Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish
jhn	21:14	This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his
jhn	21:15	So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son
jhn	21:16	He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas,
jhn	21:17	He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest
jhn	21:18	Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou
jhn	21:19	This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God.
jhn	21:20	Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved
jhn	21:23	Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that
jhn	21:24	This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote
jhn	21:25	And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which,
act	1:1	The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus
act	1:5	For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with
act	1:6	When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying,
act	1:8	But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon
act	1:9	And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was
act	1:10	And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up,
act	1:12	Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet,
act	1:13	And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room,
act	1:14	These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication,
act	1:15	And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples,
act	1:17	For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this
act	1:18	Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and
act	1:19	And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as
act	1:20	For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be
act	1:21	Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time
act	1:23	And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed
act	1:24	And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts
act	1:26	And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias;
act	2:1	And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with
act	2:2	And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty
act	2:3	And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and
act	2:4	And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak
act	2:5	And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of
act	2:6	Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and
act	2:7	And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another,
act	2:12	And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to
act	2:14	But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and
act	2:16	But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel; 2:17 And
act	2:22	Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man
act	2:25	For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always
act	2:28	Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me
act	2:29	Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch
act	2:30	Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an
act	2:32	This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.
act	2:33	Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having
act	2:34	For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself,
act	2:36	Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God
act	2:37	Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and
act	2:39	For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all
act	2:40	And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save
act	2:41	Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the
act	2:42	And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and
act	2:43	And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were
act	2:44	And all that believed were together, and had all things common;
act	2:45	And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men,
act	2:46	And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and
act	3:1	Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of
act	3:2	And a certain man lame from his mother’s womb was carried, whom
act	3:4	And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on
act	3:5	And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of
act	3:6	Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have
act	3:7	And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and
act	3:8	And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into
act	3:9	And all the people saw him walking and praising God: 3:10 And they
act	3:11	And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the
act	3:12	And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of
act	3:13	The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our
act	3:14	But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer
act	3:16	And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong,
act	3:17	And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did
act	3:18	But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all
act	3:19	Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be
act	3:20	And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto
act	3:22	For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord
act	3:23	And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear
act	3:24	Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow
act	3:25	Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which
act	3:26	Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to
act	4:1	And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of
act	4:3	And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next
act	4:4	Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number
act	4:5	And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders,
act	4:7	And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what
act	4:11	This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which
act	4:12	Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other
act	4:13	Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived
act	4:14	And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they
act	4:15	But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council,
act	4:17	But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly
act	4:18	And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor
act	4:19	But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be
act	4:20	For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.
act	4:21	So when they had further threatened them, they let them go,
act	4:22	For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of
act	4:23	And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported
act	4:24	And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with
act	4:27	For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast
act	4:29	And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy
act	4:31	And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were
act	4:32	And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of
act	4:33	And with great power gave the apostles witness of the
act	4:34	Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were
act	4:36	And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is,
act	5:1	But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a
act	5:3	But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie
act	5:4	Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold,
act	5:5	And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost:
act	5:6	And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and
act	5:7	And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife,
act	5:8	And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for
act	5:9	Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together
act	5:10	Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the
act	5:11	And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as
act	5:12	And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders
act	5:13	And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people
act	5:14	And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of
act	5:16	There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto
act	5:17	Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him,
act	5:19	But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and
act	5:21	And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in
act	5:22	But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison,
act	5:24	Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the
act	5:25	Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put
act	5:26	Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without
act	5:27	And when they had brought them, they set them before the council:
act	5:29	Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to
act	5:30	The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged
act	5:31	Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a
act	5:32	And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy
act	5:33	When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took
act	5:34	Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named
act	5:36	For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be
act	5:37	After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the
act	5:38	And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them
act	5:40	And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles,
act	5:41	And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing
act	5:42	And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to
act	6:1	And in those days, when the number of the disciples was
act	6:2	Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them,
act	6:3	Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest
act	6:4	But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the
act	6:5	And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose
act	6:7	And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples
act	6:8	And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and
act	6:9	Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the
act	6:10	And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by
act	6:11	Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak
act	6:12	And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes,
act	6:13	And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to
act	6:15	And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw
act	7:1	Then said the high priest, Are these things so? 7:2 And he said,
act	7:4	Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in
act	7:5	And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set
act	7:6	And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a
act	7:7	And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said
act	7:8	And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat
act	7:9	And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but
act	7:11	Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan,
act	7:12	But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out
act	7:13	And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and
act	7:14	Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his
act	7:15	So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,
act	7:16	And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that
act	7:17	But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn
act	7:19	The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our
act	7:20	In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and
act	7:22	And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was
act	7:23	And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to
act	7:24	And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged
act	7:26	And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and
act	7:28	Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday? 7:29
act	7:30	And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the
act	7:31	When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near
act	7:33	Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for
act	7:34	I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in
act	7:35	This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a
act	7:36	He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs
act	7:37	This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A
act	7:38	This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the
act	7:41	And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto
act	7:42	Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven;
act	7:44	Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as
act	7:45	Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into
act	7:47	But Solomon built him an house.
act	7:48	Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as
act	7:52	Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they
act	7:54	When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and
act	7:55	But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into
act	7:57	Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears,
act	7:59	And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord
act	7:60	And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not
act	8:1	And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was
act	8:2	And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great
act	8:3	As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every
act	8:4	Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where
act	8:5	Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ
act	8:6	And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which
act	8:7	For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that
act	8:8	And there was great joy in that city.
act	8:9	But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the
act	8:11	And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had
act	8:12	But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the
act	8:13	Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he
act	8:14	Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria
act	8:18	And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles’ hands
act	8:20	But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou
act	8:21	Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is
act	8:22	Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps
act	8:23	For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in
act	8:24	Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that
act	8:25	And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the
act	8:26	And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and
act	8:27	And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch
act	8:28	Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the
act	8:29	Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to
act	8:30	And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet
act	8:32	The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as
act	8:34	And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom
act	8:36	And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water:
act	8:38	And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down
act	8:39	And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the
act	8:40	But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached
act	9:1	And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the
act	9:3	And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there
act	9:6	And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me
act	9:7	And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a
act	9:8	And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he
act	9:9	And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor
act	9:10	And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and
act	9:11	And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which
act	9:13	Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man,
act	9:15	But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel
act	9:17	And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting
act	9:18	And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales:
act	9:19	And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul
act	9:20	And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is
act	9:21	But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that
act	9:23	And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to
act	9:25	Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the
act	9:26	And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself
act	9:27	But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and
act	9:28	And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.
act	9:29	And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed
act	9:30	Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea,
act	9:31	Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and
act	9:32	And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he
act	9:33	And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his
act	9:34	And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole:
act	9:35	And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the
act	9:36	Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by
act	9:37	And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died:
act	9:38	And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had
act	9:39	Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they
act	9:40	But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and
act	9:41	And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had
act	9:42	And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the
act	9:43	And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one
act	10:1	There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion
act	10:3	He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an
act	10:4	And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it,
act	10:5	And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname
act	10:7	And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he
act	10:9	On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto
act	10:13	And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.
act	10:14	But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing
act	10:15	And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God
act	10:16	This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into
act	10:17	Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had
act	10:19	While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him,
act	10:20	Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting
act	10:21	Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from
act	10:23	Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter
act	10:24	And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius
act	10:25	And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at
act	10:26	But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.
act	10:27	And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were
act	10:28	And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing
act	10:29	Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was
act	10:32	Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is
act	10:33	Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done
act	10:34	Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive
act	10:36	The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching
act	10:39	And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land
act	10:40	Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly; 10:41
act	10:42	And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify
act	10:43	To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name
act	10:44	While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all
act	10:45	And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as
act	10:46	For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then
act	11:1	And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the
act	11:2	And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the
act	11:4	But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded
act	11:7	And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.
act	11:8	But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at
act	11:9	But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath
act	11:10	And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into
act	11:11	And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto
act	11:12	And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover
act	11:15	And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us
act	11:16	Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John
act	11:17	Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us,
act	11:19	Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that
act	11:20	And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they
act	11:21	And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number
act	11:22	Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church
act	11:23	Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and
act	11:24	For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith:
act	11:25	Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul: 11:26 And
act	11:27	And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.
act	11:28	And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by
act	11:29	Then the disciples, every man according to his ability,
act	11:30	Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of
act	12:1	Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to
act	12:2	And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.
act	12:3	And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to
act	12:5	Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without
act	12:6	And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter
act	12:7	And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light
act	12:8	And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy
act	12:9	And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true
act	12:10	When they were past the first and the second ward, they came
act	12:11	And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a
act	12:12	And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of
act	12:13	And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to
act	12:14	And when she knew Peter’s voice, she opened not the gate for
act	12:15	And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly
act	12:16	But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door,
act	12:17	But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace,
act	12:18	Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the
act	12:19	And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he
act	12:20	And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but
act	12:21	And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his
act	12:22	And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god,
act	12:23	And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave
act	12:24	But the word of God grew and multiplied.
act	12:25	And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had
act	13:1	Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets
act	13:2	As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said,
act	13:3	And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on
act	13:4	So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto
act	13:5	And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in
act	13:6	And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a
act	13:7	Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a
act	13:8	But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation)
act	13:9	Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost,
act	13:10	And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of

act	13:13	Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to
act	13:14	But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in
act	13:15	And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of
act	13:16	Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of
act	13:17	The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted
act	13:18	And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in
act	13:19	And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan,
act	13:20	And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four
act	13:21	And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul
act	13:22	And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be
act	13:23	Of this man’s seed hath God according to his promise raised unto
act	13:25	And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I
act	13:26	Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and
act	13:27	For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they
act	13:28	And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they
act	13:29	And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they
act	13:30	But God raised him from the dead: 13:31 And he was seen many
act	13:32	And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which
act	13:34	And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no

act	13:36	For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of
act	13:37	But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.
act	13:38	Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through
act	13:40	Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in
act	13:42	And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles
act	13:43	Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and
act	13:44	And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to
act	13:45	But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with
act	13:46	Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary
act	13:47	For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be
act	13:48	And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified
act	13:49	And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the
act	13:50	But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the
act	13:51	But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came
act	13:52	And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.
act	14:1	And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into
act	14:2	But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their
act	14:3	Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which
act	14:4	But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the
act	14:5	And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also
act	14:8	And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet,
act	14:11	And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their
act	14:12	And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because
act	14:13	Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought
act	14:14	Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent
act	14:17	Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did
act	14:18	And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that
act	14:19	And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium,
act	14:20	Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and
act	14:21	And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had
act	14:23	And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had
act	14:24	And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to
act	14:25	And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down
act	14:27	And when they were come, and had gathered the church together,
act	14:28	And there they abode long time with the disciples.
act	15:1	And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren,
act	15:2	When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and
act	15:3	And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through
act	15:4	And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the
act	15:5	But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which
act	15:6	And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this
act	15:7	And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said
act	15:8	And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them
act	15:10	Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of
act	15:11	But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ
act	15:12	Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to
act	15:13	And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men
act	15:15	And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,
act	15:16	After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of
act	15:18	Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the
act	15:19	Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from
act	15:21	For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him,
act	15:22	Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church,
act	15:24	Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us
act	15:25	It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send
act	15:27	We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you
act	15:28	For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you
act	15:30	So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they
act	15:32	And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted
act	15:33	And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in
act	15:34	Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.
act	15:35	Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and
act	15:36	And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and
act	15:37	And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname
act	15:38	But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed
act	15:39	And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed
act	15:41	And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.
act	16:1	Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple
act	16:3	Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and
act	16:4	And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the
act	16:5	And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased
act	16:6	Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of
act	16:8	And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.
act	16:9	And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of
act	16:10	And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to
act	16:11	Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to
act	16:13	And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side,
act	16:14	And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city
act	16:15	And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us,
act	16:16	And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel
act	16:18	And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and
act	16:19	And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone,
act	16:22	And the multitude rose up together against them: and the
act	16:23	And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them
act	16:25	And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto
act	16:26	And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the
act	16:27	And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and
act	16:28	But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm:
act	16:29	Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling,
act	16:32	And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that
act	16:33	And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their
act	16:34	And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before
act	16:35	And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying,
act	16:36	And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The
act	16:37	But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned,
act	16:38	And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and
act	16:39	And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and
act	16:40	And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of
act	17:1	Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they
act	17:4	And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and
act	17:5	But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them
act	17:6	And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain
act	17:8	And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when
act	17:9	And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they
act	17:10	And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night
act	17:11	These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they
act	17:12	Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which
act	17:13	But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of
act	17:14	And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it
act	17:15	And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and
act	17:16	Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred
act	17:17	Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with
act	17:18	Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks,
act	17:19	And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May
act	17:21	(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent
act	17:23	For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar
act	17:24	God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he
act	17:25	Neither is worshipped with men’s hands, as though he needed any
act	17:29	Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to
act	17:30	And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now
act	17:32	And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some
act	17:33	So Paul departed from among them.
act	17:34	Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the
act	18:1	After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to
act	18:3	And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and
act	18:4	And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the
act	18:5	And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was
act	18:6	And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his
act	18:7	And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man’s house,
act	18:8	And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the
act	18:9	Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not
act	18:11	And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word
act	18:12	And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made
act	18:14	And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto
act	18:16	And he drave them from the judgment seat.
act	18:17	Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the
act	18:18	And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then
act	18:19	And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself
act	18:20	When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he
act	18:22	And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the
act	18:23	And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went
act	18:24	And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent
act	18:25	This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being
act	18:26	And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila
act	18:27	And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren
act	19:1	And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul
act	19:3	And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they
act	19:4	Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of
act	19:5	When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord
act	19:6	And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came
act	19:7	And all the men were about twelve.
act	19:8	And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of
act	19:9	But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil
act	19:10	And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they
act	19:11	And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul: 19:12 So
act	19:13	Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to
act	19:14	And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the
act	19:15	And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I
act	19:17	And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at
act	19:18	And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their
act	19:19	Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books
act	19:20	So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.
act	19:21	After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when
act	19:22	So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him,
act	19:23	And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.
act	19:24	For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made
act	19:25	Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and
act	19:26	Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost
act	19:28	And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and
act	19:29	And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught
act	19:30	And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the
act	19:31	And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent
act	19:32	Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the
act	19:33	And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting
act	19:34	But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about
act	19:35	And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men
act	19:37	For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers
act	19:38	Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him,
act	19:39	But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall
act	19:40	For we are in danger to be called in question for this day’s
act	19:41	And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.
act	20:1	And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the
act	20:2	And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much
act	20:4	And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the
act	20:5	These going before tarried for us at Troas.
act	20:6	And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened
act	20:7	And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came
act	20:8	And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were
act	20:9	And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus,
act	20:10	And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said,
act	20:11	When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and
act	20:12	And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little
act	20:13	And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there
act	20:14	And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to
act	20:15	And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios;
act	20:16	For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not
act	20:17	And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of
act	20:18	And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from
act	20:22	And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not
act	20:24	But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear
act	20:25	And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone
act	20:26	Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the
act	20:27	For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of
act	20:28	Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over
act	20:29	For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves
act	20:30	Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse
act	20:31	Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years
act	20:32	And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his
act	20:33	I have coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or apparel.
act	20:34	Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto
act	20:35	I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to
act	20:36	And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with
act	20:37	And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul’s neck, and kissed him,
act	20:38	Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they
act	21:1	And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had
act	21:3	Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand,
act	21:4	And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to
act	21:5	And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our
act	21:6	And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and
act	21:7	And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to
act	21:8	And the next day we that were of Paul’s company departed, and
act	21:9	And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.
act	21:10	And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a
act	21:11	And when he was come unto us, he took Paul’s girdle, and bound
act	21:12	And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place,
act	21:13	Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine
act	21:14	And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will
act	21:15	And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to
act	21:16	There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea,
act	21:17	And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us
act	21:18	And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all
act	21:19	And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what
act	21:20	And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto
act	21:22	What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together:
act	21:23	Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which
act	21:25	As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and
act	21:26	Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with
act	21:27	And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were
act	21:29	(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an
act	21:30	And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and
act	21:31	And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief
act	21:32	Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto
act	21:33	Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded
act	21:34	And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and
act	21:35	And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne
act	21:36	For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away
act	21:37	And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the
act	21:40	And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and
act	22:2	(And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them,
act	22:4	And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering
act	22:5	As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate
act	22:6	And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come
act	22:7	And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me,
act	22:9	And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid;
act	22:10	And I said, What shall I do, LORD? And the Lord said unto me,
act	22:11	And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led
act	22:12	And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a
act	22:14	And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou
act	22:15	For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast
act	22:16	And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away
act	22:17	And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem,
act	22:19	And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every
act	22:21	And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto
act	22:22	And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up
act	22:23	And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw
act	22:25	And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion
act	22:27	Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art
act	22:28	And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this
act	22:29	Then straightway they departed from him which should have
act	22:30	On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty
act	23:1	And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and
act	23:2	And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to
act	23:3	Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall:
act	23:6	But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the
act	23:7	And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the
act	23:8	For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither
act	23:9	And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the
act	23:10	And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain,
act	23:11	And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of
act	23:12	And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and
act	23:13	And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.
act	23:14	And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have
act	23:15	Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain
act	23:16	And when Paul’s sister’s son heard of their lying in wait, he
act	23:17	Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring
act	23:18	So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said,
act	23:19	Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him
act	23:20	And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou
act	23:21	But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him
act	23:22	So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged
act	23:23	And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two
act	23:25	And he wrote a letter after this manner: 23:26 Claudius Lysias
act	23:27	This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of
act	23:28	And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused
act	23:30	And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man,
act	23:31	Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and
act	23:32	On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and
act	23:34	And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what
act	24:1	And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the
act	24:2	And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him,
act	24:4	Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray
act	24:5	For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of
act	24:7	But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great
act	24:9	And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.
act	24:10	Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to
act	24:11	Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but
act	24:12	And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man,
act	24:14	But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call
act	24:16	And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience
act	24:17	Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and
act	24:18	Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the
act	24:19	Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had
act	24:20	Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil
act	24:22	And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge
act	24:23	And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have
act	24:24	And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla,
act	24:25	And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to
act	24:26	He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul,
act	24:27	But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix’ room: and
act	25:1	Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he
act	25:2	Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him
act	25:4	But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and
act	25:5	Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down
act	25:6	And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went
act	25:7	And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem
act	25:8	While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the
act	25:9	But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and
act	25:11	For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of
act	25:12	Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered,
act	25:13	And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto
act	25:14	And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul’s
act	25:16	To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to
act	25:17	Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the
act	25:18	Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none
act	25:20	And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him
act	25:21	But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of
act	25:22	Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself.
act	25:23	And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with
act	25:24	And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here
act	25:25	But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death,
act	25:26	Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore
act	25:27	For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not
act	26:1	Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for
act	26:4	My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among
act	26:6	And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of
act	26:8	Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God
act	26:10	Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did
act	26:11	And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them
act	26:12	Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission
act	26:14	And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice
act	26:15	And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom
act	26:16	But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee
act	26:19	Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the
act	26:21	For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went
act	26:22	Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day,
act	26:24	And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice,
act	26:25	But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth
act	26:26	For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak
act	26:27	King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou
act	26:28	Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a
act	26:29	And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all
act	26:30	And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor,
act	26:32	Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at
act	27:1	And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they
act	27:2	And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to
act	27:3	And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously
act	27:4	And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus,
act	27:5	And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we
act	27:6	And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into
act	27:7	And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come
act	27:9	Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous,
act	27:11	Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of
act	27:12	And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more
act	27:13	And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had
act	27:14	But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind,
act	27:15	And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the
act	27:16	And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we
act	27:18	And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day
act	27:20	And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no
act	27:21	But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them,
act	27:22	And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no
act	27:23	For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am,
act	27:25	Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it
act	27:26	Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.
act	27:27	But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and
act	27:29	Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast
act	27:30	And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they
act	27:32	Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her
act	27:33	And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take
act	27:34	Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your
act	27:35	And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to
act	27:36	Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.
act	27:37	And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and
act	27:38	And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and
act	27:39	And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered
act	27:40	And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed
act	27:41	And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship
act	27:42	And the soldiers’ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of
act	27:43	But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their
act	28:1	And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was
act	28:2	And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they
act	28:3	And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on
act	28:4	And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand,
act	28:5	And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.
act	28:6	Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down
act	28:7	In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the
act	28:8	And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a
act	28:9	So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the
act	28:11	And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria,
act	28:12	And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.
act	28:13	And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and
act	28:15	And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to
act	28:16	And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners
act	28:17	And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief
act	28:18	Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because
act	28:19	But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal
act	28:20	For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and
act	28:21	And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of
act	28:22	But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as
act	28:23	And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him
act	28:24	And some believed the things which were spoken, and some
act	28:25	And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after
act	28:28	Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is
act	28:29	And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had
act	28:30	And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and
rom	1:1	Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle,
rom	1:8	First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your
rom	1:9	For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel
rom	1:11	For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual
rom	1:13	Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I
rom	1:14	I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to
rom	1:15	So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you
rom	1:16	For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power
rom	1:17	For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to
rom	1:18	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
rom	1:20	For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world
rom	1:22	Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, 1:23 And
rom	1:24	Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts
rom	1:25	Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and
rom	1:26	For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even
rom	1:28	And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge,
rom	2:1	Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that
rom	2:2	But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth
rom	2:3	And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such
rom	2:12	For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without
rom	2:13	(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the
rom	2:14	For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the
rom	2:17	Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest
rom	2:21	Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself?
rom	2:25	For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if
rom	2:26	Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the
rom	3:1	What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of
rom	3:3	For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the
rom	3:5	But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what
rom	3:9	What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have
rom	3:10	As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: 3:11
rom	3:12	They are all gone out of the way, they are together become
rom	3:13	Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have
rom	3:19	Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to
rom	3:20	Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be
rom	3:21	But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested,
rom	3:25	Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his
rom	3:27	Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works?
rom	3:28	Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without
rom	3:29	Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles?
rom	3:31	Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we
rom	4:1	What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to
rom	4:3	For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was
rom	4:4	Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but
rom	4:5	But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth
rom	4:6	Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto
rom	4:8	Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.
rom	4:9	Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon
rom	4:10	How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in
rom	4:11	And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the
rom	4:13	For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not
rom	4:14	For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void,
rom	4:16	Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end
rom	4:18	Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the
rom	4:19	And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now
rom	4:22	And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.
rom	4:23	Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to
rom	5:1	Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through
rom	5:3	And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that
rom	5:6	For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for
rom	5:7	For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure
rom	5:8	But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet
rom	5:9	Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be
rom	5:10	For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the
rom	5:11	And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus
rom	5:12	Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by
rom	5:14	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them
rom	5:15	But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through
rom	5:16	And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the
rom	5:17	For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they
rom	5:19	For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by
rom	5:20	Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But
rom	6:1	What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may
rom	6:5	For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death,
rom	6:7	For he that is dead is freed from sin.
rom	6:8	Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live
rom	6:10	For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he
rom	6:11	Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin,
rom	6:12	Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should
rom	6:13	Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness
rom	6:14	For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under
rom	6:15	What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but
rom	6:16	Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey,
rom	6:18	Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of
rom	6:19	I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your
rom	6:20	For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from
rom	6:21	What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now
rom	6:22	But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye
rom	6:23	For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal
rom	7:1	Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,)
rom	7:3	So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another
rom	7:4	Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the
rom	7:5	For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by
rom	7:6	But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we
rom	7:7	What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not
rom	7:8	But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all
rom	7:9	For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment
rom	7:10	And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be
rom	7:11	For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by
rom	7:12	Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just,
rom	7:13	Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But
rom	7:14	For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold
rom	7:15	For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not;
rom	7:16	If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that
rom	7:17	Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
rom	7:18	For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good
rom	7:19	For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would
rom	7:20	Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin
rom	7:21	I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present
rom	7:22	For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: 7:23 But I
rom	7:24	O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of
rom	8:1	There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ
rom	8:2	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me
rom	8:3	For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the
rom	8:5	For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh;
rom	8:6	For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded
rom	8:7	Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not
rom	8:8	So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
rom	8:9	But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the
rom	8:10	And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the
rom	8:11	But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
rom	8:12	Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live
rom	8:13	For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through
rom	8:14	For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of
rom	8:15	For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but
rom	8:16	The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are
rom	8:18	For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not
rom	8:19	For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the
rom	8:20	For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but
rom	8:22	For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in
rom	8:23	And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits
rom	8:24	For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for
rom	8:26	Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not
rom	8:27	And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the
rom	8:28	And we know that all things work together for good to them that
rom	8:29	For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be
rom	8:30	Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom
rom	8:31	What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can
rom	8:34	Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather,
rom	8:35	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation,
rom	8:37	Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him
rom	8:38	For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
rom	8:39	Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to
rom	9:1	I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing
rom	9:3	For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my
rom	9:6	Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are
rom	9:8	That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not
rom	9:9	For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and
rom	9:10	And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one,
rom	9:13	As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.
rom	9:14	What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God
rom	9:15	For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have
rom	9:16	So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth,
rom	9:17	For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose
rom	9:18	Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he
rom	9:19	Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who
rom	9:26	And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said
rom	9:27	Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the
rom	9:29	And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us
rom	9:30	What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not
rom	9:31	But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath
rom	9:32	Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by
rom	10:1	Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that
rom	10:2	For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not
rom	10:3	For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about
rom	10:4	For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one
rom	10:5	For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That
rom	10:6	But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise,
rom	10:10	For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with
rom	10:11	For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be
rom	10:12	For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for
rom	10:13	For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be
rom	10:14	How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?
rom	10:18	But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went
rom	10:19	But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will
rom	10:20	But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that
rom	10:21	But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my
rom	11:1	I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also
rom	11:2	God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not
rom	11:4	But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to
rom	11:5	Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant
rom	11:6	And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is
rom	11:7	What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for;
rom	11:8	(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of
rom	11:9	And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and
rom	11:11	I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God
rom	11:12	Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the
rom	11:15	For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world,
rom	11:17	And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a
rom	11:19	Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might
rom	11:20	Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou
rom	11:22	Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which
rom	11:23	And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be
rom	11:24	For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by
rom	11:26	And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall
rom	11:28	As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but
rom	11:29	For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.
rom	11:30	For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now
rom	11:32	For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have
rom	11:33	O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of
rom	12:1	I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye
rom	12:2	And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the
rom	12:3	For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is
rom	12:4	For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not
rom	12:6	Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given
rom	12:9	Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil;
rom	12:10	Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in
rom	12:14	Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.
rom	12:15	Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.
rom	12:16	Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things,
rom	12:17	Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the
rom	12:18	If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with
rom	12:19	Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place
rom	12:20	Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give
rom	12:21	Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
rom	13:1	Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no
rom	13:2	Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance
rom	13:3	For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt
rom	13:5	Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also
rom	13:6	For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God’s
rom	13:7	Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is
rom	13:8	Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth
rom	13:9	For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill,
rom	13:10	Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the
rom	13:11	And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake
rom	13:12	The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore
rom	13:13	Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and
rom	13:14	But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for
rom	14:1	Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful
rom	14:2	For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is
rom	14:3	Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not
rom	14:4	Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? to his own
rom	14:5	One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every
rom	14:6	He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he
rom	14:7	For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.
rom	14:8	For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die,
rom	14:9	For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he
rom	14:10	But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at
rom	14:11	For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall
rom	14:12	So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.
rom	14:13	Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this
rom	14:14	I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is
rom	14:15	But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou
rom	14:16	Let not then your good be evil spoken of: 14:17 For the kingdom
rom	14:18	For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God,
rom	14:19	Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace,
rom	14:20	For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are
rom	14:21	It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any
rom	14:22	Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that
rom	14:23	And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not
rom	15:1	We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the

rom	15:4	For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our

rom	15:8	Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision
rom	15:9	And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is
rom	15:10	And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.
rom	15:11	And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all

rom	15:14	And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also
rom	15:15	Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you
rom	15:17	I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in
rom	15:18	For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ
rom	15:20	Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ
rom	15:22	For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to
rom	15:23	But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great
rom	15:25	But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.
rom	15:26	For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a

rom	15:33	Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
rom	16:1	I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the

rom	16:5	Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my

rom	16:7	Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners,
rom	16:8	Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord.

rom	16:17	Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and
rom	16:18	For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but
rom	16:19	For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad
rom	16:20	And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.
rom	16:21	Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater,

rom	16:24	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
rom	16:25	Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my
1co	1:1	Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of
1co	1:4	I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which
1co	1:9	God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his
1co	1:10	Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus
1co	1:11	For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them
1co	1:12	Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I
1co	1:13	Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye
1co	1:16	And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know
1co	1:17	For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not
1co	1:18	For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish
1co	1:19	For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and
1co	1:20	Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of
1co	1:22	For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:
1co	1:23	But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock,
1co	1:25	Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the
1co	1:26	For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men
1co	1:30	But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us
1co	2:1	And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of
1co	2:2	For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus
1co	2:3	And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much
1co	2:4	And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of
1co	2:6	Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the
1co	2:9	But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither
1co	2:10	But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit
1co	2:11	For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man
1co	2:12	Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit
1co	2:13	Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom
1co	2:14	But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of
1co	2:15	But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is
1co	2:16	For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct
1co	3:1	And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but
1co	3:2	I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were
1co	3:3	For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and
1co	3:7	So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that
1co	3:8	Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man
1co	3:9	For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, ye
1co	3:10	According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise
1co	3:11	For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is
1co	3:12	Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious
1co	3:14	If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall
1co	3:15	If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he
1co	3:16	Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of
1co	3:18	Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be
1co	3:19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is
1co	3:20	And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they
1co	3:21	Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;
1co	3:22	Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or
1co	4:1	Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and
1co	4:2	Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.
1co	4:3	But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of
1co	4:4	For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but
1co	4:5	Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who
1co	4:6	And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to
1co	4:7	For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou
1co	4:9	For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it
1co	4:10	We are fools for Christ’s sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are
1co	4:11	Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are
1co	4:14	I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I
1co	4:15	For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet have
1co	4:16	Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.
1co	4:17	For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved
1co	4:18	Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.
1co	4:19	But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know,
1co	4:20	For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.
1co	4:21	What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and
1co	5:2	And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that
1co	5:3	For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have
1co	5:6	Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven
1co	5:9	I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:
1co	5:10	Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with
1co	5:11	But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man
1co	5:12	For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not
1co	6:1	Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before
1co	6:4	If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set
1co	6:5	I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man
1co	6:7	Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to
1co	6:9	Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of
1co	6:10	Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
1co	6:11	And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are
1co	6:12	All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient:
1co	6:13	Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall
1co	6:14	And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us
1co	6:15	Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I
1co	6:16	What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one
1co	6:17	But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.
1co	6:18	Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body;
1co	6:19	What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost
1co	7:1	Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for
1co	7:2	Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own
1co	7:3	Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise
1co	7:4	The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and
1co	7:5	Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a
1co	7:6	But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.
1co	7:7	For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath
1co	7:8	I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them
1co	7:9	But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to
1co	7:10	And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not
1co	7:12	But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife
1co	7:13	And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he
1co	7:14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the
1co	7:15	But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a
1co	7:16	For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy
1co	7:18	Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become
1co	7:19	Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the
1co	7:20	Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.
1co	7:21	Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou
1co	7:22	For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord’s
1co	7:23	Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.
1co	7:24	Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with
1co	7:25	Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I
1co	7:26	I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I
1co	7:27	Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou
1co	7:28	But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin
1co	7:29	But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that
1co	7:31	And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion
1co	7:32	But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried
1co	7:34	There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The
1co	7:35	And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare
1co	7:36	But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his
1co	7:37	Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no
1co	7:38	So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that
1co	7:39	The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but
1co	7:40	But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I
1co	8:1	Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all
1co	8:2	And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing
1co	8:3	But if any man love God, the same is known of him.
1co	8:4	As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are
1co	8:5	For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in
1co	8:7	Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with
1co	8:8	But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we
1co	8:9	But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a
1co	8:10	For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the
1co	8:13	Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh
1co	9:1	Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ
1co	9:3	Mine answer to them that do examine me is this, 9:4 Have we not
1co	9:11	If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if
1co	9:13	Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of
1co	9:15	But I have used none of these things: neither have I written
1co	9:16	For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for
1co	9:18	What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I
1co	9:19	For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant
1co	9:20	And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews;
1co	9:22	To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am
1co	9:23	And this I do for the gospel’s sake, that I might be partaker
1co	9:24	Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one
1co	9:25	And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all
1co	9:26	I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one
1co	10:1	Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how
1co	10:5	But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were
1co	10:6	Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not
1co	10:7	Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written,
1co	10:8	Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and
1co	10:9	Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and
1co	10:10	Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were
1co	10:11	Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they
1co	10:12	Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he
1co	10:13	There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man:
1co	10:14	Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.
1co	10:15	I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.
1co	10:16	The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of
1co	10:18	Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the
1co	10:21	Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye
1co	10:22	Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
1co	10:23	All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient:
1co	10:24	Let no man seek his own, but every man another’s wealth.
1co	10:25	Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question
1co	10:27	If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be
1co	10:28	But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto
1co	10:32	Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor
1co	11:1	Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.
1co	11:2	Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things,
1co	11:3	But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ;
1co	11:4	Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered,
1co	11:5	But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head
1co	11:6	For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it
1co	11:7	For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is
1co	11:8	For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.
1co	11:9	Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the
1co	11:10	For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because
1co	11:11	Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the
1co	11:12	For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the
1co	11:13	Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God
1co	11:16	But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom,
1co	11:17	Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye
1co	11:18	For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear
1co	11:19	For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are
1co	11:20	When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to
1co	11:21	For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and
1co	11:22	What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye
1co	11:23	For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto
1co	11:25	After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped,
1co	11:26	For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do
1co	11:27	Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of
1co	11:28	But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread,
1co	11:29	For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh
1co	11:30	For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many
1co	11:31	For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
1co	11:32	But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we
1co	11:33	Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one
1co	11:34	And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not
1co	12:1	Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you
1co	12:2	Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb
1co	12:3	Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the
1co	12:4	Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.
1co	12:5	And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.
1co	12:6	And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God
1co	12:7	But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to
1co	12:8	For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another
1co	12:12	For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the
1co	12:13	For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we
1co	12:14	For the body is not one member, but many.
1co	12:15	If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of
1co	12:19	And if they were all one member, where were the body? 12:20 But
1co	12:21	And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee:
1co	12:22	Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more
1co	12:24	For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the
1co	12:25	That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members
1co	12:26	And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it;
1co	12:27	Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.
1co	12:28	And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily
1co	12:29	Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all
1co	13:1	Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have
1co	13:2	And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all
1co	13:3	And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I
1co	13:4	Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity
1co	13:8	Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they
1co	13:9	For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
1co	13:10	But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in
1co	13:11	When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child,
1co	13:12	For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face:
1co	13:13	And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the
1co	14:1	Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that
1co	14:2	For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men,
1co	14:3	But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and
1co	14:4	He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he
1co	14:5	I would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye
1co	14:6	Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what
1co	14:10	There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and
1co	14:11	Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be
1co	14:12	Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek
1co	14:13	Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that
1co	14:14	For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my
1co	14:15	What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray
1co	14:16	Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that
1co	14:18	I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all: 14:19 Yet
1co	14:20	Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be
1co	14:21	In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other
1co	14:22	Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but
1co	14:23	If therefore the whole church be come together into one place,
1co	14:26	How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of
1co	14:27	If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at
1co	14:28	But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the
1co	14:29	Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.
1co	14:30	If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the
1co	14:31	For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all
1co	14:32	And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
1co	14:33	For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all
1co	14:34	Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not
1co	14:35	And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at
1co	14:36	What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you
1co	14:38	But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.
1co	14:39	Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak
1co	14:40	Let all things be done decently and in order.
1co	15:1	Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I
1co	15:2	By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached
1co	15:3	For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received,
1co	15:7	After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.
1co	15:8	And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due
1co	15:9	For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called
1co	15:10	But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was
1co	15:11	Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye
1co	15:12	Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say
1co	15:14	And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your
1co	15:15	Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have
1co	15:16	For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: 15:17 And
1co	15:18	Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.
1co	15:19	If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men
1co	15:20	But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the
1co	15:21	For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection
1co	15:22	For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made
1co	15:23	But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits;
1co	15:24	Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom
1co	15:25	For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.
1co	15:26	The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.
1co	15:27	For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all
1co	15:28	And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the
1co	15:29	Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the
1co	15:32	If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus,
1co	15:33	Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.
1co	15:34	Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the
1co	15:35	But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what
1co	15:39	All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh
1co	15:40	There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the
1co	15:41	There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon,
1co	15:42	So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in
1co	15:45	And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul;
1co	15:46	Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is
1co	15:47	The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the
1co	15:48	As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is
1co	15:49	And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear
1co	15:50	Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit
1co	15:51	Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we
1co	15:53	For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal
1co	15:54	So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and
1co	15:55	O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?
1co	15:56	The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.
1co	15:57	But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our
1co	15:58	Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable,
1co	16:1	Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given
1co	16:2	Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in
1co	16:3	And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters,
1co	16:4	And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.
1co	16:5	Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia:
1co	16:6	And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that
1co	16:7	For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a
1co	16:8	But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.
1co	16:9	For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are
1co	16:10	Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear:
1co	16:11	Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in
1co	16:12	As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come
1co	16:13	Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.
1co	16:14	Let all your things be done with charity.
1co	16:15	I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that
1co	16:17	I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and
1co	16:18	For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore
1co	16:19	The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you
1co	16:20	All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with
1co	16:21	The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.
1co	16:22	If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be
1co	16:23	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
1co	16:24	My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
2co	1:1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy
2co	1:3	Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
2co	1:5	For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation
2co	1:6	And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and
2co	1:7	And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers
2co	1:8	For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which
2co	1:12	For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that
2co	1:13	For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or
2co	1:15	And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that
2co	1:17	When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the
2co	1:19	For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by
2co	1:20	For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto
2co	1:21	Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed
2co	1:23	Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you
2co	1:24	Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of
2co	2:1	But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to
2co	2:2	For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but
2co	2:4	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you
2co	2:5	But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part:
2co	2:6	Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted
2co	2:7	So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort
2co	2:8	Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward
2co	2:9	For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of
2co	2:10	To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave
2co	2:12	Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ’s gospel, and
2co	2:14	Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in
2co	2:15	For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are
2co	3:1	Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some
2co	3:4	And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward: 3:5 Not that we
2co	3:7	But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones,
2co	3:10	For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this
2co	3:11	For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which
2co	3:12	Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of
2co	3:15	But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon
2co	3:16	Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be
2co	3:17	Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is,
2co	3:18	But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of
2co	4:1	Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy,
2co	4:3	But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: 4:4 In
2co	4:5	For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and
2co	4:6	For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath
2co	4:7	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency
2co	4:8	We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are
2co	4:11	For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake,
2co	4:12	So then death worketh in us, but life in you.
2co	4:13	We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I
2co	4:15	For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might
2co	4:16	For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish,
2co	4:17	For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for
2co	5:1	For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were
2co	5:2	For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with
2co	5:4	For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not
2co	5:5	Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who
2co	5:6	Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at
2co	5:9	Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be
2co	5:10	For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that
2co	5:11	Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we
2co	5:12	For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you
2co	5:13	For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we
2co	5:14	For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge,
2co	5:16	Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though
2co	5:17	Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old
2co	5:18	And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by
2co	5:19	To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto
2co	5:20	Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech
2co	5:21	For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we
2co	6:1	We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye
2co	6:2	(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the
2co	6:8	By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as
2co	6:11	O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is
2co	6:12	Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own
2co	6:13	Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,)
2co	6:14	Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what
2co	6:17	Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the
2co	6:18	And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and
2co	7:1	Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse
2co	7:2	Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we
2co	7:3	I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye
2co	7:4	Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of
2co	7:5	For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but
2co	7:6	Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down,
2co	7:8	For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though
2co	7:9	Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed
2co	7:10	For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be
2co	7:11	For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly
2co	7:12	Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause
2co	7:13	Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly
2co	7:14	For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed;
2co	7:15	And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he
2co	7:16	I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.
2co	8:1	Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed
2co	8:3	For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power
2co	8:5	And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own
2co	8:6	Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would
2co	8:7	Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance,
2co	8:8	I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of
2co	8:9	For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he
2co	8:10	And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who
2co	8:11	Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a
2co	8:12	For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to
2co	8:13	For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened: 8:14 But
2co	8:16	But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the
2co	8:17	For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward,
2co	8:18	And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the
2co	8:22	And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes
2co	8:23	Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and
2co	8:24	Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of
2co	9:1	For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous
2co	9:3	Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be
2co	9:5	Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they
2co	9:6	But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also
2co	9:7	Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give;
2co	9:8	And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye,
2co	9:10	Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for
2co	9:12	For the administration of this service not only supplieth the
2co	9:15	Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.
2co	10:1	Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of
2co	10:3	For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:
2co	10:4	(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty
2co	10:7	Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man
2co	10:8	For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which
2co	10:10	For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his
2co	10:11	Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by
2co	10:12	For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare
2co	10:13	But we will not boast of things without our measure, but
2co	10:14	For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we
2co	10:17	But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
2co	10:18	For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the
2co	11:1	Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and
2co	11:2	For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have
2co	11:3	But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve
2co	11:4	For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not
2co	11:5	For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.
2co	11:6	But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have
2co	11:7	Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be
2co	11:8	I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.
2co	11:9	And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to
2co	11:10	As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this
2co	11:11	Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.
2co	11:12	But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from
2co	11:13	For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming
2co	11:14	And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of
2co	11:15	Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be
2co	11:16	I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a
2co	11:17	That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it
2co	11:18	Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.
2co	11:19	For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.
2co	11:20	For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour
2co	11:21	I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak.
2co	11:22	Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are
2co	11:23	Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in
2co	11:24	Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.
2co	11:25	Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I
2co	11:28	Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me
2co	11:29	Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?
2co	11:30	If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern
2co	11:31	The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed
2co	11:32	In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of
2co	12:1	It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to
2co	12:2	I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the
2co	12:3	And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body,
2co	12:5	Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but
2co	12:6	For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I
2co	12:7	And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance
2co	12:8	For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart
2co	12:9	And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my
2co	12:10	Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in
2co	12:11	I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I
2co	12:12	Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all
2co	12:13	For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches,
2co	12:14	Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not
2co	12:15	And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the
2co	12:16	But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty,
2co	12:17	Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?
2co	12:18	I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a
2co	12:20	For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I
2co	13:1	This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or
2co	13:2	I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the
2co	13:4	For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by
2co	13:5	Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own
2co	13:7	Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear
2co	13:8	For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
2co	13:9	For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this
2co	13:10	Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present
2co	13:11	Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be
2co	13:12	Greet one another with an holy kiss.
2co	13:13	All the saints salute you.
2co	13:14	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the
gal	1:1	Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus
gal	1:6	I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into
gal	1:8	But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel
gal	1:9	As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other
gal	1:10	For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men?
gal	1:11	But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached
gal	1:12	For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by
gal	1:13	For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’
gal	1:15	But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb,
gal	1:18	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and
gal	1:19	But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s
gal	1:20	Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie
gal	1:21	Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia; 1:22 And
gal	1:23	But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times
gal	1:24	And they glorified God in me.
gal	2:1	Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with
gal	2:2	And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that
gal	2:3	But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled
gal	2:6	But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it
gal	2:8	(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of
gal	2:10	Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which
gal	2:11	But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face,
gal	2:12	For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the
gal	2:13	And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that
gal	2:14	But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the
gal	2:17	But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves
gal	2:18	For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself
gal	2:19	For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto
gal	2:20	I am crucified with Christ: neverthless I live; yet not I, but
gal	2:21	I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by
gal	3:1	O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not
gal	3:5	He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh
gal	3:7	Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the
gal	3:8	And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen
gal	3:9	So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.
gal	3:10	For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse:
gal	3:11	But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it
gal	3:12	And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall
gal	3:13	Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a
gal	3:15	Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a
gal	3:16	Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not,
gal	3:17	And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of
gal	3:18	For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise:
gal	3:19	Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of
gal	3:20	Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.
gal	3:21	Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if
gal	3:22	But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise
gal	3:23	But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto
gal	3:24	Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ,
gal	3:25	But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a
gal	3:26	For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.
gal	3:27	For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on
gal	3:28	There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free,
gal	3:29	And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs
gal	4:1	Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth
gal	4:3	Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the
gal	4:6	And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son
gal	4:7	Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son,
gal	4:8	Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which
gal	4:9	But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God,
gal	4:11	I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.
gal	4:12	Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have
gal	4:13	Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel
gal	4:14	And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor
gal	4:15	Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record,
gal	4:16	Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?
gal	4:17	They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude
gal	4:18	But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing,
gal	4:19	My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ
gal	4:21	Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the
gal	4:23	But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he
gal	4:24	Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants;
gal	4:25	For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to
gal	4:26	But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us
gal	4:27	For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break
gal	4:28	Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.
gal	4:29	But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that
gal	4:30	Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and
gal	4:31	So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of
gal	5:1	Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us
gal	5:2	Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ
gal	5:3	For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a
gal	5:4	Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are
gal	5:5	For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by
gal	5:6	For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
gal	5:7	Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the
gal	5:9	A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.
gal	5:10	I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none
gal	5:11	And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet
gal	5:12	I would they were even cut off which trouble you.
gal	5:13	For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not
gal	5:14	For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou
gal	5:15	But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not
gal	5:16	This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the
gal	5:17	For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against
gal	5:18	But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
gal	5:19	Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these;
gal	5:22	But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
gal	5:24	And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the
gal	5:25	If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
gal	5:26	Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another,
gal	6:1	Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are
gal	6:2	Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.
gal	6:3	For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he
gal	6:4	But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have
gal	6:5	For every man shall bear his own burden.
gal	6:6	Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that
gal	6:7	Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth,
gal	6:8	For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap
gal	6:9	And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall
gal	6:10	As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men,
gal	6:11	Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own
gal	6:12	As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they
gal	6:13	For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but
gal	6:14	But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord
gal	6:15	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
gal	6:16	And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and
gal	6:17	From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the
gal	6:18	Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
eph	1:1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the
eph	1:2	Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord
eph	1:3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath
eph	1:4	According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the
eph	1:5	Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus
eph	1:7	In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of
eph	1:13	In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth,
eph	1:15	Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus,
eph	1:20	Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and
eph	2:1	And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;
eph	2:2	Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this
eph	2:4	But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he
eph	2:8	For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
eph	2:10	For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good
eph	2:11	Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the
eph	2:14	For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down
eph	2:18	For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the
eph	2:19	Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but
eph	3:1	For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you
eph	3:8	Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace
eph	3:13	Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you,
eph	3:14	For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus
eph	3:16	That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to
eph	3:20	Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all
eph	4:1	I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk
eph	4:4	There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one
eph	4:7	But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure
eph	4:8	Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity
eph	4:9	(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first
eph	4:17	This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth
eph	4:20	But ye have not so learned Christ; 4:21 If so be that ye have
eph	4:25	Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his
eph	4:26	Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your
eph	4:28	Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour,
eph	4:29	Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that
eph	4:30	And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto
eph	4:31	Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil
eph	5:1	Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; 5:2 And walk
eph	5:3	But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not
eph	5:5	For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor
eph	5:6	Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these
eph	5:7	Be not ye therefore partakers with them.
eph	5:8	For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord:
eph	5:11	And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but
eph	5:12	For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of
eph	5:13	But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light:
eph	5:14	Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the
eph	5:15	See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,
eph	5:16	Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
eph	5:17	Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of
eph	5:18	And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with
eph	5:20	Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in
eph	5:22	Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the
eph	5:23	For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the
eph	5:24	Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives
eph	5:25	Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church,
eph	5:28	So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that
eph	5:29	For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and
eph	5:31	For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall
eph	5:32	This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the
eph	5:33	Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife
eph	6:1	Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.
eph	6:2	Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with
eph	6:4	And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring
eph	6:5	Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to
eph	6:9	And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing
eph	6:10	Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of
eph	6:11	Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand
eph	6:12	For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against
eph	6:13	Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be
eph	6:14	Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and
eph	6:17	And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit,
eph	6:21	But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a
eph	6:23	Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the
eph	6:24	Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in
php	1:1	Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the
php	1:3	I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, 1:4 Always in every
php	1:8	For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the
php	1:9	And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in
php	1:11	Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus
php	1:12	But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which
php	1:15	Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also
php	1:18	What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in
php	1:19	For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your
php	1:21	For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
php	1:22	But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet
php	1:23	For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and
php	1:25	And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and
php	1:27	Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of
php	1:29	For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to
php	2:1	If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of
php	2:3	Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness
php	2:4	Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the
php	2:5	Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: 2:6 Who,
php	2:7	But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a
php	2:9	Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name
php	2:12	Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my
php	2:13	For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his
php	2:14	Do all things without murmurings and disputings: 2:15 That ye may
php	2:17	Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your
php	2:18	For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.
php	2:19	But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you,
php	2:20	For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your
php	2:21	For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s.
php	2:22	But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he
php	2:23	Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see
php	2:24	But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.
php	2:25	Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my
php	2:26	For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because
php	2:27	For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him;
php	2:28	I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him
php	2:29	Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold
php	3:1	Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same
php	3:2	Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.
php	3:3	For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and
php	3:4	Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man
php	3:6	Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the
php	3:7	But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.
php	3:8	Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency
php	3:9	And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is
php	3:12	Not as though I had already attained, either were already
php	3:13	Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one
php	3:15	Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if
php	3:16	Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by
php	3:17	Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk
php	3:18	(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you
php	4:1	Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and
php	4:2	I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same
php	4:3	And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which
php	4:4	Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.
php	4:5	Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.
php	4:6	Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and
php	4:7	And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep
php	4:8	Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things
php	4:9	Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard,
php	4:10	But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your
php	4:11	Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in
php	4:12	I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every
php	4:13	I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.
php	4:14	Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with
php	4:15	Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the
php	4:16	For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my
php	4:17	Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound
php	4:18	But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of
php	4:19	But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in
php	4:20	Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
php	4:21	Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with
php	4:22	All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar’s
php	4:23	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
col	1:1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God,
col	1:3	We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying

col	1:5	For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard
col	1:6	Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth
col	1:7	As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you
col	1:8	Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.
col	1:9	For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to
col	1:10	That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being
col	1:11	Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto
col	1:12	Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be
col	1:13	Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated
col	1:14	In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of
col	1:15	Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every

col	1:22	In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and

col	1:24	Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is
col	1:25	Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God
col	1:26	Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations,
col	1:27	To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this
col	1:28	Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all

col	2:2	That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and
col	2:3	In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
col	2:4	And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.
col	2:5	For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit,

col	2:7	Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have
col	2:8	Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit,
col	2:9	For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.

col	3:21	Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be
col	3:22	Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not

col	4:12	Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you,

col	4:18	The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be
1th	1:1	Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the
1th	1:2	We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in
1th	1:5	For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power,
1th	1:6	And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received
1th	1:7	So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and
1th	1:8	For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in
1th	1:9	For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had
1th	2:1	For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it
1th	2:3	For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in
1th	2:5	For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor
1th	2:7	But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her
1th	2:9	For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring
1th	2:10	Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and
1th	2:13	For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when
1th	2:14	For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which

1th	2:18	Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and
1th	2:19	For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even
1th	3:1	Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to
1th	3:4	For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we
1th	3:5	For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know
1th	3:6	But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good
1th	3:9	For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the
1th	3:12	And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward
1th	4:1	Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the
1th	4:2	For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.
1th	4:3	For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye

1th	4:8	He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath
1th	4:9	But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you:
1th	4:10	And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all
1th	4:13	But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning
1th	4:14	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them
1th	4:15	For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which

1th	4:18	Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
1th	5:1	But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I

1th	5:3	For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction
1th	5:4	But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should
1th	5:5	Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we
1th	5:6	Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be
1th	5:7	For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken
1th	5:8	But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the
1th	5:9	For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by
1th	5:11	Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another,
1th	5:12	And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among
1th	5:14	Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort
1th	5:15	See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow
1th	5:16	Rejoice evermore.
1th	5:17	Pray without ceasing.
1th	5:18	In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ
1th	5:19	Quench not the Spirit.
1th	5:20	Despise not prophesyings.
1th	5:21	Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.
1th	5:22	Abstain from all appearance of evil.
1th	5:23	And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God
1th	5:24	Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.
1th	5:25	Brethren, pray for us.
1th	5:26	Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.
1th	5:27	I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the
1th	5:28	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
2th	1:1	Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the
2th	1:3	We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet,
2th	1:11	Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count
2th	2:1	Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus
2th	2:3	Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come,
2th	2:5	Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these
2th	2:7	For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now
2th	2:8	And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall
2th	2:11	And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they
2th	2:13	But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren
2th	2:15	Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye
2th	2:16	Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father,
2th	3:1	Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have
2th	3:3	But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you
2th	3:4	And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do
2th	3:5	And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the
2th	3:6	Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus
2th	3:7	For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not
2th	3:10	For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if
2th	3:11	For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly,
2th	3:12	Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus
2th	3:13	But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.
2th	3:14	And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man,
2th	3:15	Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
2th	3:16	Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means.
2th	3:17	The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in
2th	3:18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
1ti	1:1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our
1ti	1:3	As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into
1ti	1:5	Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and
1ti	1:8	But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully; 1:9
1ti	1:12	And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that
1ti	1:14	And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and
1ti	1:15	This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that
1ti	1:16	Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus
1ti	1:17	Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise
1ti	1:18	This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the
1ti	2:1	I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers,
1ti	2:3	For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
1ti	2:4	Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge
1ti	2:5	For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the
1ti	2:7	Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the
1ti	2:8	I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands,
1ti	2:9	In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest
1ti	2:11	Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.
1ti	2:12	But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over
1ti	2:13	For Adam was first formed, then Eve.
1ti	2:14	And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in
1ti	2:15	Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they
1ti	3:1	This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he
1ti	3:2	A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife,
1ti	3:7	Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without;
1ti	3:8	Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given
1ti	3:10	And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office
1ti	3:11	Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober,
1ti	3:12	Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their
1ti	3:13	For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to
1ti	3:14	These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:
1ti	3:15	But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to
1ti	3:16	And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God
1ti	4:1	Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some
1ti	4:4	For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if
1ti	4:6	If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou
1ti	4:7	But refuse profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise thyself
1ti	4:8	For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable
1ti	4:9	This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.
1ti	4:10	For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we
1ti	4:11	These things command and teach.
1ti	4:12	Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the
1ti	4:13	Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to
1ti	4:14	Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by
1ti	4:15	Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy
1ti	4:16	Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them:
1ti	5:1	Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger
1ti	5:3	Honour widows that are widows indeed.
1ti	5:4	But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to
1ti	5:5	Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and
1ti	5:6	But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.
1ti	5:7	And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.
1ti	5:8	But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his
1ti	5:9	Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years
1ti	5:10	Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children,
1ti	5:11	But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax
1ti	5:13	And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to
1ti	5:14	I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children,
1ti	5:15	For some are already turned aside after Satan.
1ti	5:16	If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve
1ti	5:17	Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour,
1ti	5:18	For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that
1ti	5:19	Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or
1ti	5:20	Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.
1ti	5:21	I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the
1ti	5:22	Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s
1ti	5:23	Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s
1ti	5:24	Some men’s sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment;
1ti	5:25	Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and
1ti	6:1	Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters
1ti	6:2	And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them,
1ti	6:3	If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words,
1ti	6:6	But godliness with contentment is great gain.
1ti	6:7	For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can
1ti	6:8	And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.
1ti	6:9	But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and
1ti	6:10	For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some
1ti	6:11	But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after
1ti	6:12	Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life,
1ti	6:13	I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all
1ti	6:17	Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not
1ti	6:20	O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding
2ti	1:1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to
2ti	1:3	I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure
2ti	1:6	Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of
2ti	1:7	For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of
2ti	1:8	Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of
2ti	1:12	For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am
2ti	1:13	Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me,
2ti	1:14	That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy
2ti	1:15	This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away
2ti	1:16	The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft
2ti	1:18	The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in
2ti	2:1	Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ
2ti	2:2	And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses,
2ti	2:3	Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
2ti	2:4	No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this
2ti	2:5	And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned,
2ti	2:6	The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the
2ti	2:7	Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all
2ti	2:8	Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from
2ti	2:10	Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sakes, that they
2ti	2:11	It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall
2ti	2:14	Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the
2ti	2:15	Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth
2ti	2:16	But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto
2ti	2:17	And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus
2ti	2:19	Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this
2ti	2:20	But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of
2ti	2:21	If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel
2ti	2:22	Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith,
2ti	2:23	But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do
2ti	2:24	And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto
2ti	3:1	This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.
2ti	3:2	For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters,
2ti	3:6	For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead
2ti	3:8	Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist
2ti	3:9	But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be
2ti	3:10	But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose,
2ti	3:12	Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
2ti	3:13	But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving,
2ti	3:14	But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast
2ti	3:16	All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable
2ti	4:1	I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who
2ti	4:2	Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove,
2ti	4:3	For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine;
2ti	4:5	But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of
2ti	4:6	For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is
2ti	4:7	I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept
2ti	4:9	Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me: 4:10 For Demas hath
2ti	4:11	Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he
2ti	4:12	And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.
2ti	4:13	The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest,
2ti	4:14	Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him
2ti	4:16	At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me:
2ti	4:17	Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that
2ti	4:18	And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will
2ti	4:19	Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.
2ti	4:20	Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum
2ti	4:21	Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee,
2ti	4:22	The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you.
tit	1:1	Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according
tit	1:5	For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in
tit	1:7	For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not
tit	1:10	For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers,
tit	1:12	One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The
tit	1:13	This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they
tit	1:15	Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled
tit	1:16	They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him,
tit	2:1	But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine: 2:2 That
tit	2:3	The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh
tit	2:6	Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.
tit	2:7	In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine
tit	2:9	Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to
tit	2:11	For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all
tit	2:13	Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the
tit	2:15	These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority.
tit	3:1	Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to
tit	3:3	For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient,
tit	3:4	But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man
tit	3:8	This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou

tit	3:10	A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition
tit	3:12	When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to

heb	1:1	God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past
heb	1:5	For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son,
heb	1:7	And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his
heb	1:8	But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and
heb	1:9	Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God,
heb	1:10	And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the
heb	1:13	But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right
heb	2:2	For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every
heb	2:3	How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at
heb	2:6	But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that
heb	2:7	Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him
heb	2:8	Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that
heb	2:9	But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for

heb	2:11	For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all
heb	2:13	And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and
heb	2:14	Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood,

heb	2:17	Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his
heb	2:18	For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to

heb	3:2	Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was
heb	3:3	For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch
heb	3:4	For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all
heb	3:5	And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for

heb	3:10	Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do
heb	3:11	So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.) 3:12
heb	3:13	But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any

heb	5:4	And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called
heb	5:5	So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest;
heb	5:6	As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever
heb	5:7	Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and
heb	5:9	And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation
heb	5:11	Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered,
heb	5:12	For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that

heb	6:15	And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
heb	6:16	For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation
heb	6:17	Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of

heb	7:7	And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.
heb	7:8	And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them,
heb	7:9	And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes
heb	7:10	For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met
heb	7:11	If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for

heb	7:27	Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up
heb	7:28	For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the
heb	8:1	Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have
heb	8:3	For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices:
heb	8:4	For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that

heb	8:7	For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no

heb	8:10	For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of

heb	8:13	In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now
heb	9:1	Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine
heb	9:2	For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the
heb	9:3	And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the
heb	9:6	Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always
heb	9:7	But into the second went the high priest alone once every year,
heb	9:11	But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a

heb	9:18	Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without
heb	9:19	For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people
heb	9:21	Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the
heb	9:22	And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and
heb	9:23	It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the

heb	10:2	For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that
heb	10:3	But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins
heb	10:4	For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats

heb	10:7	Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written
heb	10:8	Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings
heb	10:10	By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the
heb	10:11	And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering

heb	10:18	Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for
heb	10:19	Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest
heb	10:23	Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering;
heb	10:26	For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge
heb	10:28	He that despised Moses’ law died without mercy under two or

heb	10:35	Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great
heb	10:36	For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will
heb	10:37	For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and
heb	10:38	Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my
heb	10:39	But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them
heb	11:1	Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of

heb	11:3	Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the
heb	11:4	By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than
heb	11:5	By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and
heb	11:6	But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that
heb	11:7	By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet,
heb	11:8	By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which
heb	11:9	By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange
heb	11:11	Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive
heb	11:12	Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so
heb	11:13	These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but
heb	11:14	For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a
heb	11:15	And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence
heb	11:16	But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly:
heb	11:17	By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he
heb	11:20	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.
heb	11:21	By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of

heb	12:5	And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as
heb	12:7	If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for
heb	12:9	Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us,
heb	12:11	Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but
heb	12:12	Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble
heb	12:14	Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man

heb	12:25	See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped

heb	13:1	Let brotherly love continue.
heb	13:2	Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have
heb	13:3	Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them
heb	13:4	Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but
heb	13:5	Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content
heb	13:6	So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not

heb	13:15	By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God
heb	13:16	But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such
heb	13:17	Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves:
heb	13:18	Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all
heb	13:19	But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored
heb	13:20	Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord

heb	13:25	Grace be with you all. Amen.
jas	1:1	James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ,
jas	1:2	My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers
jas	1:4	But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and
jas	1:5	If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all
jas	1:6	But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth
jas	1:7	For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the
jas	1:8	A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.
jas	1:9	Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted: 1:10
jas	1:11	For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it
jas	1:12	Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is
jas	1:13	Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God
jas	1:15	Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin,
jas	1:16	Do not err, my beloved brethren.
jas	1:17	Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh
jas	1:18	Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we

jas	1:21	Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of
jas	1:22	But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your
jas	1:23	For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like
jas	1:25	But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth
jas	1:26	If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his
jas	1:27	Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To
jas	2:1	My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord
jas	2:2	For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in
jas	2:10	For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one
jas	2:11	For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill.
jas	2:12	So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law
jas	2:13	For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no
jas	2:14	What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith,
jas	2:18	Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me
jas	2:19	Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils
jas	2:20	But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
jas	2:21	Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had
jas	2:24	Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by
jas	2:25	Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when
jas	2:26	For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without
jas	3:1	My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive
jas	3:2	For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word,
jas	3:3	Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us;
jas	3:4	Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are
jas	3:5	Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things.
jas	3:7	For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of
jas	3:9	Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we
jas	3:10	Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My
jas	3:11	Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and
jas	3:13	Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him
jas	3:14	But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory
jas	3:15	This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual,
jas	3:16	For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every
jas	3:17	But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable,
jas	3:18	And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make
jas	4:1	From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not
jas	4:3	Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume
jas	4:4	Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of
jas	4:5	Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that
jas	4:7	Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will
jas	4:8	Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your
jas	4:9	Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to
jas	4:10	Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you
jas	4:11	Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of
jas	4:12	There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who
jas	4:15	For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do
jas	4:16	But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.
jas	4:17	Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to
jas	5:1	Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall
jas	5:2	Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.
jas	5:3	Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a
jas	5:4	Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your
jas	5:5	Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have
jas	5:6	Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.
jas	5:7	Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.
jas	5:8	Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the
jas	5:9	Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned:
jas	5:10	Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of
jas	5:11	Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the
jas	5:12	But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven,
jas	5:13	Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him

jas	5:16	Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another,
jas	5:17	Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed
jas	5:18	And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth

1pe	1:1	Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered
1pe	1:3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
1pe	1:6	Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be,
1pe	1:10	Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched
1pe	1:11	Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which
1pe	1:12	Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us
1pe	1:13	Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to
1pe	1:16	Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.
1pe	1:17	And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons
1pe	1:22	Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through
1pe	1:24	For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower
1pe	1:25	But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word
1pe	2:1	Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies,
1pe	2:4	To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men,
1pe	2:6	Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in
1pe	2:7	Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them
1pe	2:9	But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy
1pe	2:10	Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of
1pe	2:11	Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain
1pe	2:13	Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake:
1pe	2:15	For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to
1pe	2:17	Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.
1pe	2:18	Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to

1pe	2:20	For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye
1pe	2:21	For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered
1pe	2:25	For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the
1pe	3:1	Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that,
1pe	3:3	Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the
1pe	3:5	For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who
1pe	3:7	Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge,
1pe	3:8	Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another,
1pe	3:10	For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain
1pe	3:12	For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are
1pe	3:13	And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that
1pe	3:15	But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to
1pe	3:17	For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for
1pe	3:18	For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the
1pe	3:21	The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not
1pe	4:1	Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm
1pe	4:3	For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the

1pe	4:7	But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and
1pe	4:8	And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for
1pe	4:9	Use hospitality one to another without grudging.
1pe	4:10	As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same
1pe	4:11	If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man
1pe	4:12	Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is
1pe	4:14	If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the
1pe	4:15	But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an
1pe	4:16	Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but
1pe	4:17	For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of
1pe	5:1	The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and
1pe	5:4	And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown
1pe	5:5	Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all
1pe	5:6	Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he
1pe	5:8	Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a
1pe	5:10	But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal
1pe	5:11	To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
1pe	5:12	By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have
1pe	5:13	The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you,
1pe	5:14	Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you
2pe	1:1	Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them
2pe	1:5	And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue;
2pe	1:8	For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye
2pe	1:9	But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar
2pe	1:10	Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your
2pe	1:12	Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in
2pe	1:13	Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir
2pe	1:15	Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to
2pe	1:16	For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made
2pe	1:17	For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there
2pe	1:18	And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with
2pe	1:19	We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well
2pe	1:21	For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but
2pe	2:1	But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there
2pe	2:2	And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the
2pe	2:3	And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make
2pe	2:4	For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down
2pe	2:11	Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not
2pe	2:12	But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and
2pe	2:17	These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a
2pe	2:18	For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure
2pe	2:19	While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants
2pe	2:20	For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world
2pe	2:21	For it had been better for them not to have known the way of
2pe	2:22	But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The
2pe	3:1	This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which
2pe	3:5	For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God
2pe	3:8	But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is
2pe	3:9	The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count
2pe	3:10	But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the
2pe	3:11	Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner
2pe	3:14	Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be
2pe	3:15	And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even
2pe	3:17	Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware
2pe	3:18	But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour
1jn	1:1	That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we
1jn	1:4	And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.
1jn	1:5	This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare
1jn	1:6	If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness,
1jn	1:8	If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth
1jn	1:9	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our
1jn	1:10	If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his
1jn	2:1	My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin
1jn	2:3	And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his
1jn	2:4	He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a
1jn	2:5	But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God
1jn	2:6	He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk,
1jn	2:7	Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old
1jn	2:8	Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in
1jn	2:9	He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in
1jn	2:10	He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is
1jn	2:11	But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in
1jn	2:12	I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven
1jn	2:13	I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from
1jn	2:14	I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that
1jn	2:15	Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If
1jn	2:16	For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust
1jn	2:17	And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that
1jn	2:18	Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that
1jn	2:19	They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had
1jn	2:20	But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.
1jn	2:21	I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but
1jn	2:22	Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is
1jn	2:23	Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that
1jn	2:24	Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the
1jn	2:25	And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal
1jn	2:26	These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce
1jn	2:27	But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you,
1jn	2:28	And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall
1jn	2:29	If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that
1jn	3:1	Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that
1jn	3:2	Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear
1jn	3:3	And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even
1jn	3:4	Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is
1jn	3:5	And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in
1jn	3:6	Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not
1jn	3:7	Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth
1jn	3:8	He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from
1jn	3:9	Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed
1jn	3:10	In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the
1jn	3:11	For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we
1jn	3:12	Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother.
1jn	3:13	Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.
1jn	3:14	We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love
1jn	3:15	Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no
1jn	3:16	Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life
1jn	3:17	But whoso hath this world’s good, and seeth his brother have
1jn	3:19	And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our
1jn	3:20	For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and
1jn	3:21	Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence
1jn	3:22	And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his
1jn	3:23	And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name
1jn	3:24	And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in
1jn	4:1	Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether
1jn	4:2	Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth
1jn	4:4	Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because
1jn	4:5	They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the
1jn	4:6	We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of
1jn	4:7	Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every
1jn	4:8	He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.
1jn	4:9	In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God
1jn	4:10	Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and
1jn	4:11	Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.
1jn	4:12	No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God
1jn	4:13	Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he
1jn	4:14	And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to
1jn	4:15	Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God
1jn	4:16	And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God
1jn	4:17	Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the
1jn	4:18	There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear:
1jn	4:19	We love him, because he first loved us.
1jn	4:20	If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar:
1jn	5:1	Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and
1jn	5:2	By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love
1jn	5:3	For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and
1jn	5:4	For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is
1jn	5:5	Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that
1jn	5:7	For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the
1jn	5:8	And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and
1jn	5:9	If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater:
1jn	5:10	He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself:
1jn	5:11	And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life,
1jn	5:12	He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of
1jn	5:13	These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of
1jn	5:14	And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask
1jn	5:16	If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he
1jn	5:17	All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.
1jn	5:18	We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is
1jn	5:19	And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in
1jn	5:20	And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an
1jn	5:21	Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.
2jn	1:1	The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in
2jn	1:3	Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from
2jn	1:4	I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth,
2jn	1:5	And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new
2jn	1:6	And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the
2jn	1:7	For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not
2jn	1:8	Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have
2jn	1:9	Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of
2jn	1:10	If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive
2jn	1:12	Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with
2jn	1:13	The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.
3jn	1:1	The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.
3jn	1:2	Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be
3jn	1:3	For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of
3jn	1:4	I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.
3jn	1:5	Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the
3jn	1:8	We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers
3jn	1:9	I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the
3jn	1:10	Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth,
3jn	1:11	Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good.
3jn	1:12	Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself:
3jn	1:13	I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write
jud	1:1	Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them
jud	1:3	Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common
jud	1:4	For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of
jud	1:5	I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this,
jud	1:6	And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their
jud	1:7	Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like
jud	1:8	Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise
jud	1:9	Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he
jud	1:10	But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but
jud	1:11	Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran
jud	1:12	These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with
jud	1:14	And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these,
jud	1:16	These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts;
jud	1:17	But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of
jud	1:19	These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the
jud	1:20	But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith,
jud	1:22	And of some have compassion, making a difference: 1:23 And others
jud	1:24	Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to
rev	1:1	The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew
rev	1:3	Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this
rev	1:4	John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you,
rev	1:7	Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and
rev	1:8	I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the
rev	1:9	I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation,
rev	1:10	I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and heard behind me a
rev	1:12	And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being
rev	1:14	His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow;
rev	1:16	And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth
rev	1:17	And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his
rev	1:19	Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are,
rev	2:1	Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith
rev	2:4	Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left
rev	2:5	Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do
rev	2:6	But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the
rev	2:7	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
rev	2:8	And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things
rev	2:10	Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the
rev	2:11	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
rev	2:12	And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things
rev	2:14	But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there
rev	2:15	So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the
rev	2:16	Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight
rev	2:17	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
rev	2:18	And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things
rev	2:20	Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou
rev	2:21	And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she
rev	2:22	Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery
rev	2:23	And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches
rev	2:24	But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as
rev	2:25	But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.
rev	2:26	And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him
rev	2:28	And I will give him the morning star.
rev	2:29	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
rev	3:1	And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things
rev	3:2	Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are
rev	3:3	Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold
rev	3:4	Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their
rev	3:5	He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment;
rev	3:6	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
rev	3:7	And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things
rev	3:9	Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they
rev	3:10	Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep
rev	3:11	Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no
rev	3:12	Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God,
rev	3:13	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
rev	3:14	And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These
rev	3:16	So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I
rev	3:17	Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and
rev	3:19	As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore,
rev	3:20	Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice,
rev	3:21	To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne,
rev	3:22	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
rev	4:1	After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and
rev	4:2	And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set
rev	4:3	And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine
rev	4:4	And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon
rev	4:5	And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and
rev	4:6	And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal:
rev	4:7	And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a
rev	4:8	And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they
rev	4:9	And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that
rev	5:1	And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book
rev	5:2	And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is
rev	5:4	And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to
rev	5:5	And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of
rev	5:6	And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four
rev	5:7	And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that
rev	5:8	And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and
rev	5:9	And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the
rev	5:11	And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about
rev	5:13	And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and
rev	5:14	And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders
rev	6:1	And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as
rev	6:2	And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a
rev	6:3	And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast
rev	6:4	And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given
rev	6:5	And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast
rev	6:6	And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure
rev	6:7	And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the
rev	6:8	And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on
rev	6:9	And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the
rev	6:12	And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there
rev	6:14	And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together;
rev	6:15	And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men,
rev	7:2	And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal
rev	7:4	And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were
rev	7:5	Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of
rev	7:6	Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of
rev	7:7	Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe
rev	7:8	Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe
rev	7:9	After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man
rev	7:11	And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the
rev	7:13	And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these
rev	7:15	Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day
rev	7:16	They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall
rev	7:17	For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them,
rev	8:1	And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in
rev	8:2	And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them
rev	8:3	And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden
rev	8:4	And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the
rev	8:5	And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the
rev	8:6	And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared
rev	8:7	The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled
rev	8:8	And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain
rev	8:10	And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from
rev	8:12	And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was
rev	8:13	And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of
rev	9:2	And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of
rev	9:3	And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto
rev	9:4	And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of
rev	9:5	And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that
rev	9:6	And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and
rev	9:7	And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto
rev	9:8	And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as
rev	9:9	And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and
rev	9:10	And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in
rev	9:11	And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the
rev	9:12	One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter.
rev	9:13	And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four
rev	9:15	And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour,
rev	9:16	And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred
rev	9:17	And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on
rev	9:18	By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and
rev	9:19	For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their
rev	9:20	And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues
rev	10:1	And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed
rev	10:4	And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about
rev	10:5	And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth
rev	10:8	And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and
rev	10:9	And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little
rev	10:10	And I took the little book out of the angel’s hand, and ate it
rev	10:11	And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many
rev	11:1	And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel
rev	11:2	But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure
rev	11:3	And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall
rev	11:4	These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing
rev	11:5	And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their
rev	11:6	These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of
rev	11:7	And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that
rev	11:8	And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city,
rev	11:9	And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall
rev	11:10	And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and
rev	11:11	And after three days and an half the spirit of life from God
rev	11:12	And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come
rev	11:13	And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth
rev	11:14	The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh
rev	11:15	And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in
rev	11:16	And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their
rev	11:18	And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time
rev	11:19	And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen
rev	12:1	And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with
rev	12:3	And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great
rev	12:4	And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did
rev	12:5	And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations
rev	12:6	And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place
rev	12:7	And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought
rev	12:9	And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the
rev	12:10	And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come
rev	12:11	And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word
rev	12:12	Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to
rev	12:13	And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he
rev	12:14	And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she
rev	12:15	And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the
rev	12:16	And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth,
rev	12:17	And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war
rev	13:1	And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out
rev	13:2	And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet
rev	13:3	And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his
rev	13:4	And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast:
rev	13:6	And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme
rev	13:7	And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to
rev	13:8	And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names
rev	13:9	If any man have an ear, let him hear.
rev	13:10	He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that
rev	13:11	And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he
rev	13:12	And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him,
rev	13:13	And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down
rev	13:15	And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that
rev	13:16	And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free
rev	13:18	Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number
rev	14:1	And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with
rev	14:2	And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and
rev	14:4	These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are
rev	14:5	And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault
rev	14:6	And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the
rev	14:8	And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is
rev	14:9	And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If
rev	14:11	And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever:
rev	14:12	Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the
rev	14:13	And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed
rev	14:14	And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one
rev	14:15	And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud
rev	14:16	And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth;
rev	14:17	And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he
rev	14:18	And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over
rev	14:19	And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered
rev	14:20	And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came
rev	15:1	And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven
rev	15:2	And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them
rev	15:3	And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song
rev	15:4	Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou
rev	15:5	And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the
rev	15:7	And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven
rev	15:8	And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and
rev	16:1	And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven
rev	16:2	And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and
rev	16:3	And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it
rev	16:4	And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and
rev	16:5	And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O
rev	16:6	For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou
rev	16:7	And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God
rev	16:8	And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power
rev	16:9	And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of
rev	16:10	And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the
rev	16:12	And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river
rev	16:13	And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth
rev	16:14	For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go
rev	16:15	Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and
rev	16:16	And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew
rev	16:17	And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and
rev	16:18	And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there
rev	16:19	And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities
rev	16:20	And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.
rev	16:21	And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone
rev	17:1	And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials,
rev	17:3	So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I
rev	17:4	And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and
rev	17:5	And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE
rev	17:6	And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and
rev	17:7	And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will
rev	17:8	The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out
rev	17:9	And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven
rev	17:10	And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the
rev	17:11	And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and
rev	17:12	And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have
rev	17:13	These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength
rev	17:14	These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome
rev	17:15	And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the
rev	17:16	And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall
rev	17:17	For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to
rev	17:18	And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which
rev	18:1	And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven,
rev	18:2	And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the
rev	18:3	For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her
rev	18:4	And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her,
rev	18:5	For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered
rev	18:6	Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double
rev	18:7	How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so
rev	18:8	Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning,
rev	18:9	And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and
rev	18:11	And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her;
rev	18:14	And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from
rev	18:15	The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her,
rev	18:16	And saying, Alas, alas that great city, that was clothed in fine
rev	18:20	Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and
rev	18:21	And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and
rev	18:22	And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and
rev	18:24	And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and
rev	19:1	And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in
rev	19:3	And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and
rev	19:4	And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and
rev	19:5	And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all
rev	19:6	And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the
rev	19:7	Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the
rev	19:8	And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen,
rev	19:9	And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called
rev	19:10	And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See
rev	19:11	And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that
rev	19:12	His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many
rev	19:13	And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name
rev	19:14	And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white
rev	19:15	And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should
rev	19:16	And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING
rev	19:17	And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud
rev	19:19	And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their
rev	19:20	And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that
rev	19:21	And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon
rev	20:1	And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the
rev	20:2	And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the
rev	20:4	And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given
rev	20:5	But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years
rev	20:6	Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection:
rev	20:7	And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed
rev	20:9	And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the
rev	20:10	And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire
rev	20:11	And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from
rev	20:12	And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the
rev	20:13	And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and
rev	20:14	And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the
rev	20:15	And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast
rev	21:1	And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and
rev	21:2	And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God
rev	21:3	And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the
rev	21:4	And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there
rev	21:5	And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things
rev	21:6	And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the
rev	21:7	He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his
rev	21:8	But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and
rev	21:9	And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the
rev	21:10	And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high
rev	21:14	And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the
rev	21:15	And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the
rev	21:16	And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the
rev	21:17	And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four
rev	21:18	And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city
rev	21:19	And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with
rev	21:20	The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh,
rev	21:21	And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: every several gate was
rev	21:22	And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the
rev	21:23	And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to
rev	21:24	And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light
rev	21:25	And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there
rev	21:26	And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into
rev	21:27	And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that
rev	22:1	And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal,
rev	22:2	In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the
rev	22:3	And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of
rev	22:5	And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle,
rev	22:6	And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the
rev	22:7	Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of
rev	22:8	And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard
rev	22:9	Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy
rev	22:10	And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of
rev	22:11	He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is
rev	22:12	And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give
rev	22:13	I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and
rev	22:14	Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have
rev	22:15	For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and
rev	22:16	I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in
rev	22:17	And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth
rev	22:18	For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the
rev	22:20	He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly.
rev	22:21	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
