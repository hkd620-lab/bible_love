T|EN=Genesis 26|KO=
V|N=1|EN=And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.|KO=
V|N=2|EN=And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:|KO=
V|N=3|EN=Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;|KO=
V|N=4|EN=And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;|KO=
V|N=5|EN=Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.|KO=
V|N=6|EN=And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:|KO=
V|N=7|EN=And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.|KO=
V|N=8|EN=And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.|KO=
V|N=9|EN=And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.|KO=
V|N=10|EN=And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.|KO=
V|N=11|EN=And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.|KO=
V|N=12|EN=Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.|KO=
V|N=13|EN=And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:|KO=
V|N=14|EN=For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.|KO=
V|N=15|EN=For all the wells which his father’s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.|KO=
V|N=16|EN=And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.|KO=
V|N=17|EN=And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.|KO=
V|N=18|EN=And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.|KO=
V|N=19|EN=And Isaac’s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.|KO=
V|N=20|EN=And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac’s herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.|KO=
V|N=21|EN=And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.|KO=
V|N=22|EN=And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.|KO=
V|N=23|EN=And he went up from thence to Beersheba.|KO=
V|N=24|EN=And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham’s sake.|KO=
V|N=25|EN=And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac’s servants digged a well.|KO=
V|N=26|EN=Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.|KO=
V|N=27|EN=And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?|KO=
V|N=28|EN=And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;|KO=
V|N=29|EN=That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.|KO=
V|N=30|EN=And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.|KO=
V|N=31|EN=And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.|KO=
V|N=32|EN=And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.|KO=
V|N=33|EN=And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day.|KO=
V|N=34|EN=And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:|KO=
V|N=35|EN=Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.|KO=
