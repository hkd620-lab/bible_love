V|N=5|EN=And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.|KO=

V|N=17|EN=And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram’s wife.|KO=
V|N=18|EN=And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?|KO=
