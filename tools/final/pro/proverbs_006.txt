T|EN=Proverbs 6|KO=
V|N=1|EN=My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,|KO=
V|N=2|EN=Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.|KO=
V|N=3|EN=Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.|KO=
V|N=4|EN=Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.|KO=
V|N=5|EN=Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.|KO=
V|N=6|EN=Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:|KO=
V|N=7|EN=Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,|KO=
V|N=8|EN=Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.|KO=
V|N=9|EN=How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?|KO=
V|N=10|EN=Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:|KO=
V|N=11|EN=So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.|KO=
V|N=12|EN=A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.|KO=
V|N=13|EN=He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;|KO=
V|N=14|EN=Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.|KO=
V|N=15|EN=Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.|KO=
V|N=16|EN=These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him:|KO=
V|N=17|EN=A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,|KO=
V|N=18|EN=An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,|KO=
V|N=19|EN=A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.|KO=
V|N=20|EN=My son, keep thy father’s commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:|KO=
V|N=21|EN=Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck.|KO=
V|N=22|EN=When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.|KO=
V|N=23|EN=For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:|KO=
V|N=24|EN=To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.|KO=
V|N=25|EN=Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.|KO=
V|N=26|EN=For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adultress will hunt for the precious life.|KO=
V|N=27|EN=Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?|KO=
V|N=28|EN=Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?|KO=
V|N=29|EN=So he that goeth in to his neighbour’s wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.|KO=
V|N=30|EN=Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;|KO=
V|N=31|EN=But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.|KO=
V|N=32|EN=But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.|KO=
V|N=33|EN=A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.|KO=
V|N=34|EN=For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.|KO=
V|N=35|EN=He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.|KO=
